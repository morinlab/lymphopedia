## Overview
MGA acts as a transcriptional repressor and interacts with MYC, a well-known oncogene. Mutations in MGA have been described in DLBCL.[@jalladesExomeSequencingIdentifies2017] One study suggested MGA mutations were more common in DLBCLs in patients of African ancestry.[@reddyGeneticFunctionalDrivers2017] The mutation pattern in MGA is consistent with a role as a tumour suppressor gene. 


## Experimental Evidence

Driver mutations affecting this gene in DLBCL have been experimentally demonstrated to cause a reduction or loss of function (LOF).[@depaoliMGASuppressorMYC2013]
