# STAT6

[[_TOC_]]

## Overview
The STAT6 gene, which encodes a transcription factor involved in the JAK-STAT signaling pathway, plays a significant role in the pathogenesis of various lymphomas, including diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Below is a summary of the common mutations in the STAT6 gene identified in DLBCL. Mutations in the DNA binding domain of STAT6 are common in PMBCL and more rare in DLBCL. 


## Experimental Evidence

Driver mutations affecting this gene in DLBCL/FL have been experimentally demonstrated to cause a gain of function (GOF).[@mentzPARP14NovelTarget2022]

## STAT6 Hotspots

Recurrent mutations at the D419 amino acid residue are a common feature in DLBCL, specifically affecting the germinal center B (GCB) cell subtype. These mutations lead to the activation of the JAK/STAT signaling pathway, contributing to lymphomagenesis [@morinGeneticLandscapesRelapsed2016].
