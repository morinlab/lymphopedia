[[_TOC_]]

## Overview
BCL10 (B-cell lymphoma/leukemia 10) is a gene involved in apoptosis signaling and immune response regulation. 
Mutations in BCL10 have been implicated in the pathogenesis of various lymphomas, particularly mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphomas. 
They have also been reproducibly observed in a smaller proportion of DLBCLs with the frequency in non-MALT lymphomas under some debate. 
BCL10 mutations are a feature of the BN2 genetic subgroup, mutated in nearly 40% of BN2 cases.[@wrightProbabilisticClassificationTool2020; @phelanBCL10MutantsArchitects2022]

## Experimental Evidence

BCL10 missense mutations in the CARD domain and truncating mutations have distinct functions and different effects on BTK and MALT1 inhibitors. [@xiaBCL10MutationsDefine2022]
