## Overview
The NFKBIZ gene is a significant player in NF-ÎºB signaling, with mutations leading to its deregulation. This pathway is critical in the pathogenesis of ABC DLBCL. NFKBIZ is one of [a number of genes](https://github.com/morinlab/LLMPP/wiki/ashm) affected by aberrant somatic hypermutation in B-cell lymphomas, which complicates the interpretation of mutations at this locus. The predominant cluster of mutations in NFKBIZ is in the 3' UTR and not a consequence of aSHM. NFKBIZ 3' UTR mutations confer a selective growth advantage in DLBCL cells by stabilizing NFKBIZ mRNA, resulting in increased protein levels.[@arthurGenomewideDiscoverySomatic2018] 


## Experimental Evidence

Driver mutations affecting this gene in DLBCL have been experimentally demonstrated to cause a gain of function (GOF).[@arthurGenomewideDiscoverySomatic2018]
