## Overview
FAS encodes a cell surface receptor involved in the induction of apoptosis. FAS mutations are common in DLBCL and may be more frequent in primary gastric DLBCL.[@wohlfartFASCD95Mutations2004],[@schollMutationsRegionFAS2007]
Mutations also occur in FL at a lower rate.[@morinFrequentMutationHistonemodifying2011] Although reported in one BL study,[@paneaWholeGenomeLandscape2019] overall the evidence for FAS mutations in BL remains sparse. 
Mutations in FAS often lead to a loss of function, making lymphoma cells resistant to Fas ligand-induced apoptosis, 
thereby allowing malignant cells to evade immune surveillance.[@rysFasMutationsNonHodgkins2019]
In mouse models, Fas mutations led to a significantly shorter lymphoma-specific survival and reduced sensitivity to chemotherapy.[@rysFasMutationsNonHodgkins2019]


## Experimental Evidence

Driver mutations affecting this gene in FL/DLBCL have been experimentally demonstrated to cause a reduction or loss of function (LOF).[@wangFasFADDDeathDomain2010]
