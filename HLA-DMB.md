# HLA-DMB

## Overview
HLA-DMB, along with HLA-DMA, plays a critical role in the proper functioning of HLA class II molecules. 
These genes are essential for the loading of antigenic peptides onto HLA class II molecules, facilitating the presentation of these peptides to CD4+ T cells. 
Mutations in this gene were first described in DLBCL by [HÃ¼bschmann et al](papers/hubschmannMutationalMechanismsShaping2021.md).[@hubschmannMutationalMechanismsShaping2021]
