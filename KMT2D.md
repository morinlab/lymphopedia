## Overview
KMT2D (also known as MLL2) encodes a histone H3K4 methyltransferase, playing a crucial role in germinal center B cell development and function. 
Mutations in KMT2D are among the most common mutations in FL and are also common in DLBCL.<sup>1</sup>
 KMT2D mutations are recurrent but less common in BL and MCL and many other B-cell neoplasms. Mutations typically cause loss of KMT2D function, leading to diminished H3K4 methylation, impacting gene expression that favours lymphomagenesis. 
 KMT2D mutations are associated with poor prognosis in DLBCL.<sup>2,3</sup>

First identified as mutated in DLBCL and FL in 2011 by Morin et al.<sup>1</sup>
Mutations were later described in MCL in 2013 by Bea et al.<sup>4</sup> KMT2D mutations were later reported in BL by Grande et al.<sup>5</sup>
