## Overview

Due to [minimal support](ACE#representative-mutation) in the original primary data and very few mutations reported in subsequent studies, this gene is very unlikely to be relevant in BL. 



## Relevance tier by entity

## Warnings

<<Warn("The variants reported in this gene in BL failed QC")>>


## Mutation incidence in large patient cohorts (GAMBL reanalysis)
