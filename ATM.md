## Overview

Mutations in this gene were first described in MZL by Braggio et al.[@braggioGenomicAnalysisMarginal2012] then in MCL by Bea et al.[@beaLandscapeSomaticMutations2013] ATM mutations were later described in DLBCL by Reddy et al.[@reddyGeneticFunctionalDrivers2017]



## Experimental Evidence

Driver mutations affecting this gene in DLBCL have been experimentally demonstrated to cause a reduction or loss of function (LOF).[@camachoATMGeneInactivation2002]
