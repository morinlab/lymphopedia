## Overview

Mutations in this gene were first described in MZL by Braggio et al.[@braggioGenomicAnalysisMarginal2012] then in MCL by Bea et al.[@beaLandscapeSomaticMutations2013] ATM mutations were later described in DLBCL by Reddy et al.[@reddyGeneticFunctionalDrivers2017]
Although there is [experimental data](#experimental-evidence) supporting its relevance in MCL, the role of ATM in DLBCL remains unclear.
[Selective pressure analysis](#mutation-pattern-and-selective-pressure-estimates) did not identify this gene as significantly enriched for either missense or truncating mutations, indicating that many of these mutations may represent passengers. 


## Experimental Evidence

Driver mutations affecting this gene in MCL have been experimentally demonstrated to cause a reduction or loss of function (LOF).[@camachoATMGeneInactivation2002]
