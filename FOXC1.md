# FOXC1
## Overview
FOXC1 is a transcription factor that regulates genes involved in cell growth, differentiation, and survival. While specific data on FOXC1 mutations in DLBCL are currently limited, the functional role of FOXC1 in transcription regulation and its involvement in other cancers suggest that it could play a significant role in lymphoma pathogenesis. Further research is needed to explore the implications of FOXC1 mutations in DLBCL and other B-cell lymphomas. The rate of FOXC1 varies across studies such that the actual prevalence in DLBCL remains unclear.
