# IL16

## Overview
The IL16 gene, which encodes a pro-inflammatory cytokine, plays a role in immune responses. IL-16 is highly expressed in the activated B-cell-like (ABC) subtype of DLBCL compared to the germinal center B-cell-like (GCB) subtype. The role of mutations in lymphomagenesis is not understood. Overall, the mutation rate of IL16 is relatively low in DLBCL. *Without further support, this gene may be migrated to Tier 2.*
