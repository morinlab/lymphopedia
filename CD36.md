## Overview

CD36 is a transmembrane glycoprotein involved in fatty acid metabolism, glucose intolerance, and immune responses. It is expressed on various cell types, including platelets, monocytes, and some lymphocytes. One study showed higher rates of CD36 mutations in FL relative to DLBCLs.[@pasqualucciAnalysisCodingGenome2011]
