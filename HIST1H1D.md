## Overview
This is one of several genes that encode linker histone proteins that are recurrently mutated in DLBCL and FL.[@morinMutationalStructuralAnalysis2013; @krysiakRecurrentSomaticMutations2017]
Mutations are often found in the globular domain of the protein, which is critical for its interaction with DNA and other histone proteins.
