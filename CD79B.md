## Overview
CD79B mutations significantly contribute to the pathogenesis of DLBCL by enhancing BCR signaling and promoting tumor survival. 
These mutations, especially when co-occurring with MYD88 mutations, define a unique molecular subtype.[@wrightProbabilisticClassificationTool2020] 
This has clinical and therapeutic implications as it may contribute sensitivity to BTK inhibitors. 
In an inducible mouse model of MYD88-driven DLBCL, CD79B mutations did not accelerate lymphomagenesis but demonstrated an increased sensitivity to pharmacological BTK inhibition.[@flumannInducibleCd79bMutation2024] 
In a retrospective analysis, younger patients with MCD DLBCL that were treated with ibrutinib had significantly better outcomes.[@wilsonEffectIbrutinibRCHOP2021]
The most common hotspot mutation in CD79B is at the tyrosine residue 196 (Y196). 
This and other common mutations primarily occur in the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM) domain and prevent the negative regulatory feedback provided by Lyn kinase thereby enhancing BCR signaling.[@kimCD79BMYD88Mutations2014; @davisChronicActiveBcellreceptor2010]



## Experimental Evidence

Driver mutations affecting this gene in DLBCL have been experimentally demonstrated to cause a gain of function (GOF).[@davisChronicActiveBcellreceptor2010]

## CD79B Hotspots

Mutations at Y196 enhance B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling by preventing the negative regulatory feedback provided by Lyn kinase, a feedback inhibitor of BCR signaling. This results in continuous activation of the NF-ÎºB pathway, promoting tumor cell survival and proliferation.[@kimCD79BMYD88Mutations2014]
