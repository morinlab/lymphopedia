## Overview
KRAS mutations are rare but occur in some cases of DLBCL.[@lohrDiscoveryPrioritizationSomatic2012] These often affect the most common KRAS hotspot sites that are mutated in other solid cancers (G12 and G13).


## Experimental Evidence

Driver mutations affecting this gene in DLBCL have been experimentally demonstrated to cause a gain of function (GOF).[@scheffzekRasRasGAPComplexStructural1997]
