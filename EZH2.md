## Overview
EZH2 encodes a histone methyltransferase that is a component of the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2). 
This gene is recurrently mutated in both FL and DLBCL and has a common mutation hot spot (Y646) that affects the SET domain.[@morinSomaticMutationsAltering2010]
EZH2 mutations are one of the defining features of the EZB genetic subgroup of DLBCL.[@wrightProbabilisticClassificationTool2020] 
Although mutations in EZH2 have been described in some BL patients, they are extremely rare in most BL cohorts that have been sequenced.[@loveGeneticLandscapeMutations2012; @thomasGeneticSubgroupsInform2023] 


## Experimental Evidence

Mutations at the main hotspot and some less common hotspots lead to enhanced methylation by PRC2.[@yapSomaticMutationsEZH22011]
A number of small molecule/pharmacologic inhibitors of EZH2 activity have been described.[@garapaty-raoIdentificationEZH2EZH12013; @knutsonSelectiveInhibitionEZH22014] At least one of these, tazemetostat, has shown benefit in FL.[@morinTreatingLymphomaNow2021] 
Combination therapies including EZH2 inhibitors are also under exploration for DLBCL patients with mutant EZH2.[@scholzeCombinedEZH2Bcl22020]
