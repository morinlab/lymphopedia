  abstract = {The requirement for the B-cell transcription factor OCT2 (octamer-binding protein 2, encoded by Pou2f2) in germinal center B cells has proved controversial. Here, we report that germinal center B cells are formed normally after depletion of OCT2 in a conditional knockout mouse, but their proliferation is reduced and in vivo differentiation to antibody-secreting plasma cells is blocked. This finding led us to examine the role of OCT2 in germinal center-derived lymphomas. shRNA knockdown showed that almost all diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) cell lines are addicted to the expression of OCT2 and its coactivator OCA-B. Genome-wide chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis and gene-expression profiling revealed the broad transcriptional program regulated by OCT2 that includes the expression of STAT3, IL-10, ELL2, XBP1, MYC, TERT, and ADA. Importantly, genetic alteration of OCT2 is not a requirement for cellular addiction in DLBCL. However, we detected amplifications of the POU2F2 locus in DLBCL tumor biopsies and a recurrent mutation of threonine 223 in the DNA-binding domain of OCT2. This neomorphic mutation subtly alters the DNA-binding preference of OCT2, leading to the transactivation of noncanonical target genes including HIF1a and FCRL3 Finally, by introducing mutations designed to disrupt the OCT2-OCA-B interface, we reveal a requirement for this protein-protein interface that ultimately might be exploited therapeutically. Our findings, combined with the predominantly B-cell-restricted expression of OCT2 and the absence of a systemic phenotype in our knockout mice, suggest that an OCT2-targeted therapeutic strategy would be efficacious in both major subtypes of DLBCL while avoiding systemic toxicity.},

  abstract = {Primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma (PMBL) is a well-defined subtype of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Molecular cytogenetics revealed frequent gains of 9p24. JAK2, mapping in this region, is presently regarded as a candidate oncogene because expression profiling showed high Janus kinase-2 (JAK2) transcript levels and JAK2 was found to be constitutively phosphorylated in mediastinal B-cell lymphomas. We confirm that in the MedB-1 mediastinal B-cell line, harboring a trisomy 9, JAK2 transcription is elevated and the product is highly phosphorylated. However, JAK2 is not overexpressed at the protein level. On top, JAK2 protein turnover is even delayed. This unexpected finding coincides with a biallelic mutation of the suppressor of cytokine signaling-1 (SOCS-1) gene in this cell, which abrogates SOCS box function of the protein. Ectopic expression of wild-type (wt) SOCS-1 in MedB-1 leads to growth arrest and dramatic reduction of phospho-JAK2 and its downstream partner phospho-signal transducer and activator of transcription-5 (phospho-STAT5). Ultimately, the target gene cyclin D1 is repressed in transfectants while RB1, which is silenced in MedB-1, is induced. We conclude that, in MedB-1, action of phospho-JAK2 is sustained due to defective SOCS-1. Hence, SOCS-1 qualifies as a novel tumor suppressor. Of note, SOCS-1 mutations are also present in the parental tumor of MedB-1 and were detected in 9 of 20 PMBLs.},

Here, we show that TBL1XR1 mutations skew the humoral immune response toward generating abnormal immature memory B cells (MB), while impairing plasma cell differentiation. At the molecular level, TBL1XR1 mutants co-opt SMRT/HDAC3 repressor complexes toward binding the MB cell transcription factor (TF) BACH2 at the expense of the germinal center (GC) TF BCL6, leading to pre-memory transcriptional reprogramming and cell-fate bias. Upon antigen recall, TBL1XR1 mutant MB cells fail to differentiate into plasma cells and instead preferentially reenter new GC reactions, providing evidence for a cyclic reentry lymphomagenesis mechanism. Ultimately, TBL1XR1 alterations lead to a striking extranodal immunoblastic lymphoma phenotype that mimics the human disease. Both human and murine lymphomas feature expanded MB-like cell populations, consistent with a MB-cell origin and delineating an unforeseen pathway for malignant transformation of the immune system.},

  abstract = {Persistent STAT3 activation has been found in activated B-cell like diffuse large B cell tumors (DLBCL). To investigate whether genetic mutations play a role in aberrant STAT3 signaling in DLBCL, we bi-directionally sequenced all 24 exons of the STAT3 gene in DLBCL tumors (n{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}40). We identified 2 novel point mutations in 2 separate (2/40; 5\%) patients at exon 7 and 24. Point mutation 2552G{$>$}A was a silent mutation in the stop codon. Another heterozygous mutation 857T{$>$}A encoded a methionine substitution by lysine at codon 206 (M206K) in the coiled-coil domain of STAT3. We performed site directed mutagenesis to mutate wild type (WT) STAT3α and STAT3β at codon 206 and constructed stable cell lines by lentiviral transfection of STAT3α(WT), STAT3α(M206K), STAT3β(WT) and STAT3β(M206K) plasmids. The mutation was found to increase STAT3 phosphorylation in STAT3α mutant cell lines with no effect on the STAT3β mutant cell line. Transcriptional activation was also increased in the STAT3α mutant cells compared with STAT3α WT cells as detected by a luciferase reporter assay. Moreover, STAT3α(M206K) mutant cells were resistant to JAK2 pathway inhibition compared to STAT3α WT cells. These results indicate that missense mutations in STAT3 increase signaling through the JAK/STAT pathway. JAK2 inhibitors may be useful in the patient with this STAT3 mutation as well as those with pathway activation by other mechanisms.},

We have combined chromatin immunoprecipitation and gene expression profiling after FOXP1 depletion with functional screening to identify targets of FOXP1 contributing to tumor cell survival. We find that the sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 2 (S1PR2) is repressed by FOXP1 in activated B-cell (ABC) and germinal center B-cell (GCB) DLBCL cell lines with aberrantly high FOXP1 levels; S1PR2 expression is further inversely correlated with FOXP1 expression in 3 patient cohorts. Ectopic expression of wild-type S1PR2, but not a point mutant incapable of activating downstream signaling pathways, induces apoptosis in DLBCL cells and restricts tumor growth in subcutaneous and orthotopic models of the disease. The proapoptotic effects of S1PR2 are phenocopied by ectopic expression of the small G protein Gα13 but are independent of AKT signaling. We further show that low S1PR2 expression is a strong negative prognosticator of patient survival, alone and especially in combination with high FOXP1 expression. The S1PR2 locus has previously been demonstrated to be recurrently mutated in GCB DLBCL; the transcriptional silencing of S1PR2 by FOXP1 represents an alternative mechanism leading to inactivation of this important hematopoietic tumor suppressor.},

Follicular lymphoma (FL) originates from B cells that have participated in the humoral response, and 15\% of FL samples harbor point, activating mutations in RRAGC, an essential activator of mTORC1 downstream of the sensing of cellular nutrients. The impact of recurrent RRAGC mutations in B cell function and lymphoma is unexplored. RRAGC mutations, targeted to the endogenous locus in mice, confer a partial insensitivity to nutrient deprivation, but strongly exacerbate B cell responses and accelerate lymphomagenesis, while creating a selective vulnerability to pharmacological inhibition of mTORC1. This moderate increase in nutrient signaling synergizes with paracrine cues from the supportive T cell microenvironment that activates B cells via the PI3K-Akt-mTORC1 axis. Hence, Rragc mutations sustain induced germinal centers and murine and human FL in the presence of decreased T cell help. Our results support a model in which activating mutations in the nutrient signaling pathway foster lymphomagenesis by corrupting a nutrient-dependent control over paracrine signals from the T cell microenvironment.},

All exons of the IkappaBalpha gene were directly sequenced from 10 cases of immunohistochemically classified ABC-DLBCL and from six non-ABC-DLBCL cases. Two novel polymorphisms were identified, based on their presence in tumour as well as non-tumour DNA of the respective patients: a duplication near the transcriptional start and a single nucleotide exchange in exon 1. A somatic missense mutation was identified in exon 3, in addition to a wild-type sequence in only one ABC-DLBCL case. Thus, also in this case no clonal biallelic inactivating mutation was present in the IkappaBalpha gene.

Patients were divided into high- and low-risk groups based on whether lymphoma progressed within 24~months. Genes showing significantly different frequencies between groups were selected. Survival data for patients with the selected mutant genes were analyzed. The results were validated using two other large databases to evaluate the relationship between the selected mutant genes and prognosis. The mutation frequencies of 11 genes (MYD88[L265P], SGK1, MPEG1, TP53, SPEN, NOTCH1, ETV6, TNFRSF14, MGA, CIITA, and PIM1) significantly differed between the high- and low-risk groups. The relationships between these mutant genes and patient survival were analyzed. Patients who harbored SGK1 (serum and glucocorticoid-inducible kinase 1) mutations exhibited the best prognosis. Most patients with SGK1 mutation are germinal center B-cell (GCB) subtype. Among patients with GCB DLBCL, those harboring SGK1 mutations exhibited better prognosis than those without SGK1 mutations. Most SGK1 mutations were single-base substitutions, primarily scattered throughout the catalytic domain-encoding region. Multiple SGK1 mutations were identified in a single patient. Thus, SGK1 mutations are a marker of good prognosis for DLBCL and occur predominantly in the GCB subtype of DLBCL.

Although approximately 60\% of patients who initially received a standard R-CHOP treatment likely have a 3-year event-free survival, many patients become refractory or relapsed due to the genetic heterogeneity of this malignancy. Hence, new treatment strategies are urgently needed. MEF2C, a member of the MEF2 transcription factor family gene, plays great important roles involved in the development of various tissues and the pathogenesis of lymphoma. However, the exact functions and molecular mechanisms of MEF2C in DLBCL are not fully investigated. By Sanger sequencing, we identified a novel point mutation of MEF2C at the p.N389 site in DLBCL patient, which was further validated by several DLBCL cell lines. Intriguingly, we found that the p.N389S mutation did not influence MEF2C expression, protein stability, and subcellular distribution, but enhanced its transcriptional activity. Furthermore, we demonstrated that MEF2C p.N389S mutation promotes DLBCL cell proliferation, cellular adhesion, and tumor formation in nude mice. On mechanism, our data revealed that MEF2C p.N389S mutation increases c-JUN expression, and c-JUN regulation mediated the oncogenic function of MEF2C p.N389S mutation on DLBCL cells. Our finding may provide a significant insight into the DLBCL and a compelling therapy target for this disease treatment.},

  abstract = {The proliferative burst of B lymphocytes is essential for antigen receptor repertoire diversification during the development and selective expansion of antigen-specific clones during immune responses. High proliferative activity inevitably promotes oncogenesis, the risk of which is further elevated in B lymphocytes by endogenous gene rearrangement and somatic mutations. However, B-cell-derived cancers are rare, perhaps owing to putative intrinsic tumor-suppressive mechanisms. We show that c-MYC facilitates B-cell proliferation as a protumorigenic driver and unexpectedly coengages counteracting tumor suppression through its downstream factor TFAP4. TFAP4 is mutated in human lymphoid malignancies, particularly in {$>$}10\% of Burkitt lymphomas, and reduced TFAP4 expression was associated with poor survival of patients with MYC-high B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. In mice, insufficient TFAP4 expression accelerated c-MYC-driven transformation of B cells. Mechanistically, c-MYC suppresses the stemness of developing B cells by inducing TFAP4 and restricting self-renewal of proliferating B cells. Thus, the pursuant transcription factor cascade functions as a tumor suppressor module that safeguards against the transformation of developing B cells.},

  abstract = {G proteins and their cognate G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) function as critical signal transduction molecules that regulate cell survival, proliferation, motility and differentiation. The aberrant expression and/or function of these molecules have been linked to the growth, progression and metastasis of various cancers. As such, the analysis of mutations in the genes encoding GPCRs, G proteins and their downstream targets provides important clues regarding how these signaling cascades contribute to malignancy. Recent genome-wide sequencing efforts have unveiled the presence of frequent mutations in GNA13, the gene encoding the G protein Gα13, in Burkitt's lymphoma and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). We found that mutations in the downstream target of Gα13, RhoA, are also present in Burkitt's lymphoma and DLBCL. By multiple complementary approaches, we now show that that these cancer-specific GNA13 and RHOA mutations are inhibitory in nature, and that the expression of wild-type Gα13 in B-cell lymphoma cells with mutant GNA13 has limited impact in vitro but results in a remarkable growth inhibition in vivo. Thus, although Gα13 and RhoA activity has previously been linked to cellular transformation and metastatic potential of epithelial cancers, our findings support a tumor suppressive role for Gα13 and RhoA in Burkitt's lymphoma and DLBCL.},

We show that ARID1A orchestrates B cell fate during the germinal center (GC) response, facilitating cooperative and sequential binding of PU.1 and NF-kB at crucial genes for cytokine and CD40 signaling. The absence of ARID1A tilts GC cell fate toward immature IgM+CD80-PD-L2- memory B cells, known for their potential to re-enter new GCs. When combined with BCL2 oncogene, ARID1A haploinsufficiency hastens the progression of aggressive follicular lymphomas (FLs) in mice. Patients with FL with ARID1A-inactivating mutations preferentially display an immature memory B cell-like state with increased transformation risk to aggressive disease. These observations offer mechanistic understanding into the emergence of both indolent and aggressive ARID1A-mutant lymphomas through the formation of immature memory-like clonal precursors. Lastly, we demonstrate that ARID1A mutation induces synthetic lethality to SMARCA2/4 inhibition, paving the way for potential precision therapy for high-risk patients.},

We performed whole-exome sequencing of DLBCL in a discovery cohort comprising 26 good and nine poor prognosis cases. After candidate genes were identified, prognoses were examined in 85 individuals in the DLBCL validation cohort. In the discovery cohort, five patients in the poor prognosis group harbored both a TP53 mutation and 17p deletion. Sixteen mutations were identified in OSBPL10 in nine patients in the good prognosis group, but none in the poor prognosis group. In the validation cohort, TP53 mutations and TP53 deletions were confirmed to be poor prognostic factors for overall survival (OS) (P = 0.016) and progression-free survival (PFS) (P = 0.023) only when both aberrations co-existed. OSBPL10 mutations were validated as prognostic markers for excellent OS (P = 0.037) and PFS (P = 0.041). Significant differences in OS and PFS were observed when patients were stratified into three groups-OSBPL10 mutation (best prognosis), the coexistence of both TP53 mutation and TP53 deletion (poorest prognosis), and others. In this study, the presence of both TP53 mutation and 17p/TP53 deletion, but not the individual variants, was associated with poor prognosis in DLBCL patients after treatment with rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisone (R-CHOP) or similar regimens.

Although this form of lymphoma often pursues an indolent course, in some cases it may behave in a more aggressive manner. Clinical and histological parameters have been shown to correlate with an adverse prognosis but a number of cytogenetic abnormalities may also be associated with aggressive disease. Although, the t(14;18) in itself does not affect outcome in cases of FL, secondary abnormalities that occur in a complex polyploid karyotype may identify cases with a poor prognosis. It is unusual to find both t(14;18) and C-MYC translocation in the same tumour; those cases in which it has been described include examples of high-grade B-cell NHL (either de novo or transformed FL) or B-cell acute lymphoblastic lymphoma. In this report, three cases of FL are described in which both t(14;18) and a C-MYC translocation were identified at presentation. We also summarize four further cases from the literature. This is a small series but one which raises the possibility that the presence of a C-MYC translocations at presentation may identify a particularly aggressive subtype of FL. Further studies are required to investigate the true incidence of this aberration, the impact on C-MYC regulation, clinical course and response to treatment.},

Herein, we report that combined haploinsufficiency of Crebbp and Kmt2d induces a more severe mouse lymphoma phenotype (vs either allele alone) and unexpectedly confers an immune evasive microenvironment manifesting as CD8+ T-cell exhaustion and reduced infiltration. This is linked to profound repression of immune synapse genes that mediate crosstalk with T-cells, resulting in aberrant GC B cell fate decisions. From the epigenetic perspective, we observe interaction and mutually dependent binding and function of CREBBP and KMT2D on chromatin. Their combined deficiency preferentially impairs activation of immune synapse-responsive super-enhancers, pointing to a particular dependency for both co-activators at these specialized regulatory elements. Together, our data provide an example where chromatin modifier mutations cooperatively shape and induce an immune-evasive microenvironment to facilitate lymphomagenesis.},

By applying high-throughput protein interactome screens and functional characterization, we discovered that KLHL6 regulates BCR by targeting its signaling subunits CD79A and CD79B. Loss of physiological KLHL6 expression pattern was frequent among the MCD/C5-like activated B-cell DLBCLs and was associated with higher CD79B levels and dismal outcome. Mutations in the BTB domain of KLHL6 disrupted its localization and heterodimerization, and increased surface BCR levels and signaling, whereas Kelch domain mutants had the opposite effect. Malfunctions of KLHL6 mutants extended beyond proximal BCR signaling with distinct phenotypes from KLHL6 silencing. Collectively, our findings uncover how recurrent mutations in KLHL6 alter BCR signaling and induce actionable phenotypic characteristics in DLBCL.},

However, the pathogenic role of KLHL14 in DLBCL and its molecular function are largely unknown. Here, we report that KLHL14 is in close proximity to the BCR in the endoplasmic reticulum of MCD cell line models and promotes the turnover of immature glycoforms of BCR subunits, reducing total cellular BCR levels. Loss of KLHL14 confers relative resistance to the Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor ibrutinib and promotes assembly of the MYD88-TLR9-BCR (My-T-BCR) supercomplex, which initiates prosurvival NF-κB activation. Consequently, KLHL14 inactivation allows MCD cells to maintain NF-κB signaling in the presence of ibrutinib. These findings reinforce the central role of My-T-BCR-dependent NF-κB signaling in MCD DLBCL and suggest that the genetic status of KLHL14 should be considered in clinical trials testing inhibitors of BTK and BCR signaling mediators in DLBCL.},

These data elucidate a novel mechanism of regulation of KMT2D levels by the ubiquitin pathway and uncover a role of FBXW7 in regulating oxidative phosphorylation in B-cell malignancies.

All DLBLs and three of seven MALT-type lymphomas were resistant to Fas-mediated apoptosis in vitro. Moreover, four of five MALT-type lymphomas analyzed and one of three DLBLs analyzed showed mutations in Fas mRNA transcripts but no loss of heterozygosity in the Fas promotor region. Alternative mechanisms of resistance to apoptosis, such as decreased expression of Fas or production of soluble Fas were not operative. Therefore, it is suggestive that a subgroup of MALT-type lymphoma B cells, irrespective of t(11;18)(q21;q21), escape the censoring Fas pathway by mutating and inactivating Fas. This identifies a key regulatory step in early MALT-type lymphomagenesis.},

Integrative genomic and transcriptomic analysis of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) from the British Columbia population-based registry uncovered recurrent biallelic TMEM30A loss-of-function mutations, which were associated with a favorable outcome and uniquely observed in DLBCL. Using TMEM30A-knockout systems, increased accumulation of chemotherapy drugs was observed in TMEM30A-knockout cell lines and TMEM30A-mutated primary cells, explaining the improved treatment outcome. Furthermore, we found increased tumor-associated macrophages and an enhanced effect of anti-CD47 blockade limiting tumor growth in TMEM30A-knockout models. By contrast, we show that TMEM30A loss-of-function increases B-cell signaling following antigen stimulation-a mechanism conferring selective advantage during B-cell lymphoma development. Our data highlight a multifaceted role for TMEM30A in B-cell lymphomagenesis, and characterize intrinsic and extrinsic vulnerabilities of cancer cells that can be therapeutically exploited.},

Antigen receptor genes are assembled and modified in developing lymphocytes by RAG/AID-initiated genomic rearrangements that involve the induction of DNA double strand breaks (DSBs). Although TP53 inhibits the persistence of DSBs and induces apoptosis to protect cells from genomic instability and transformation, the development of spontaneous tumors harboring clonal translocations has not been reported in mice that only lack wild-type Tp53 protein or express Tp53 mutants. Tp53-deficient (Tp53(-/-)) mice succumb to T lineage lymphomas lacking clonal translocations but develop B lymphoid tumors containing immunoglobulin (Ig) translocations upon combined inactivation of DSB repair factors, RAG mutation or AID overexpression; mice expressing apoptosis-defective Tp53 mutants develop B cell lymphomas that have not been characterized for potential genomic instability. As somatic rather than germline inactivating mutations of TP53 are typically associated with human cancers and Tp53 deletion has cellular context dependent effects upon lymphocyte transformation, we generated mice with conditional Tp53 deletion in lineage-committed B lymphocytes to avoid complications associated with defective Tp53 responses during embryogenesis and/or in multi-lineage potential cells and, thereby, directly evaluate the potential physiological role of Tp53 in suppressing translocations in differentiated cells. These mb1-cre:Tp53(flox/flox) mice succumbed to lymphoid tumors containing Ig gene rearrangements and immunophenotypes characteristic of B cells from various developmental stages. Most mb1-cre:Tp53(flox/flox) tumors harbored clonal translocations, including Igh/c-myc or other oncogenic translocations generated by the aberrant repair of RAG/AID-generated DSBs. Our data indicate that Tp53 serves critical functions in B lineage lymphocytes to prevent transformation caused by translocations in cell populations experiencing physiological levels of RAG/AID-initiated DSB intermediates, and provide evidence that the somatic TP53 mutations found in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and Burkitt's lymphoma may contribute to the development of these human malignancies.},

Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is the most common lymphoid malignancy in adults. In the present study, we aimed to detect the expression of EEF1A1 in DLBCL and to analyze its relationship with prognosis. METHODS: We reviewed medical records of DLBCL patients in our hospital and evaluated their expression level of EEF1A1 in tumor tissues using immunohistochemical (IHC) assay. The Chi-square method was used for correlation analysis. The Kaplan-Meier method with Log rank test was used for univariate analysis. Cox proportional hazards model was used for multivariate analysis. Cellular and mice models were introduced to validate its oncogenic role. RESULTS: EEF1A1 expression in tumor cells was higher in certain DLBCL cases. Patients with higher EEF1A1 expression were more likely to have advanced tumor stage and poorer 5-year overall survival (OS) rates. EEF1A1 expression in tumor cells was an independent risk predictor for OS (P {$<$} 0.05). Cellular assays demonstrated that EEF1A1-shRNA significantly inhibited lymphoma cell proliferation. The study of xenografts further verified the effect of EEF1A1-shRNA on suppressing tumor growth in vivo. CONCLUSION: EEF1A1 positivity predicts short survival in DLBCL patients. For patients with higher EEF1A1 expression, more strategy such as anti-EEF1A1 antibody treatment should be developed.},

Previous studies have suggested that the prevalence of disease subgroups and cytogenetic profiles differ between Western and Asian patients. To characterize the coding genome of Chinese DLBCL, we performed whole-exome sequencing of DNA derived from 31 tumors and respective peripheral blood samples. The mutation prevalence of B2M, CD70, DTX1, LYN, TMSB4X, and UBE2A was investigated in an additional 105 tumor samples. We discovered 11 novel targets of recurrent mutations in DLBCL that included functionally relevant genes such as LYN and TMSB4X. Additional genes were found mutated at high frequency (≥10\%) in the Chinese cohort including DTX1, which was the most prevalent mutation target in the Notch pathway. We furthermore demonstrated that mutations in DTX1 impair its function as a negative regulator of Notch. Novel and previous unappreciated targets of somatic mutations in DLBCL identified in this study support the existence of additional/alternative tumorigenic pathways in these tumors. The observed differences with previous reports might be explained by the genetic heterogeneity of DLBCL, the germline genetic makeup of Chinese individuals, and/or exposure to distinct etiological agents.},

We determined gene copy number alterations (GCNAs) of TP53, CDKN2A, CDKN1B, BCL2, MYC, REL, and RB1 with a single polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay (quantitative multiplex PCR of short fragments [QMPSF]) in a cohort of 114 patients with DLBCL to assess their prognostic value and relationship with the gene expression profile. Losses of TP53 and CDKN2A, observed in 8\% and 35\% of patients, respectively, were significantly associated with a shorter survival after rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (R-CHOP) treatment, independently of the International Prognostic Index and of the cell of origin. Analysis of the 9p21 genomic region indicated that transcripts encoding p14ARF and p16INK4A were both disrupted in most patients with CDKN2A deletion. These patients predominantly had an activated B-cell profile and showed a specific gene expression signature, characterized by dysregulation of the RB/E2F pathway, activation of cellular metabolism, and decreased immune and inflammatory responses. These features may constitute the molecular basis sustaining the unfavorable outcome and chemoresistance of this DLBCL subgroup. Detection of TP53 and CDKN2A loss by QMPSF is a powerful tool that could be used for patient stratification in future clinical trials.},

METHODS: This retrospective study included previously untreated patients diagnosed with DLBCL from January 2007 to December 2012. Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded blocks of these patients were collected. Tissue microarray was built and expression of CARD11 was examined immunohistochemically. Subtype of DLBCL was determined by Hans algorithm (CD10, BCL6, MUM1). The pattern of CARD11 was further studied and their correlation with outcome was analyzed. RESULTS: 79 patients with DLBCL were enrolled and two reactive lymph nodes were used as control. The positive rate of high CARD11 expression in DLBCL was 65.33\%, which showed no significant associations with patients' characteristics. Positive CARD11 expression was associated with an inferior event free survival (EFS)(2- year EFS: 52.03\%vs 86.12\%,P=0.036). Even in patients with a high international prognostic index (IPI, 3-5 points), this difference still remained significant (Median EFS not reached vs 557 days,P=0.033). CONCLUSION: DLBCL patients with high CARD11 expression had a shorter EFS compared with low level of CARD11. This difference remained significant when patients were in high IPI (3-5 points), which might indicate the value of CARD11 in stratification of high-risk DLBCL patients.},

In this study, we had performed target-sequencing of 360 lymphoma-related genes on 76 PT-DLBCL patients with a median age of 65 (33-89). Our data provide a comprehensive understanding of the landscape of mutations in a small subset of PT-DLBCL. METHODS: A total of 76 PT-DLBCL patients were sequenced, and their clinical data and follow-up data were collected. The relationship between mutated genes, clinical data and prognosis and survival of PT-DLBCL patients was retrospectively analyzed by statistical software. RESULTS: We observed a median of 15 protein-altering variants per patient in our data and was identified recurrent oncogenic mutations of 360 lymphoma-related genes involved in PT-DLBCL, including PIM1 (74\%), MYD88 (50\%), KMT2D (38\%), KMT2C (34\%), BTG2 (34\%), TBL1XR1 (34\%) and ETV6 (24\%). Compared with classic DLBCL, PT-DLBCL showed an increased mutation frequency of PIM1, MYD88, BTG2, while NOTCH1 appeared exclusive mutated with PIM1, MSH3 and ETV6. Cox risk model regression analysis showed that age ≥60 years, IPI 3-5 points, BTG2 gene mutation and extranodal organ invasion suggested poor prognosis. Finally, we constructed an OS predict model of PT-DLBCL patients using above factors with a high accuracy. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, our results revealed genomic characterization of PT-DLBCL, and the mutation of BTG2 was an independent factor predicting a poor prognosis.},

Using in vitro and in vivo murine models and primary patient samples, we now show that NFKBIE-mutated CLL cells are selected by microenvironmental signals that activate the NF-κB pathway and induce alterations within the tumor microenvironment that can allow for immune escape, including expansion of CD8+ T-cells with an exhausted phenotype and increased PD-L1 expression on the malignant B-cells. Consistent with the latter observations, we find increased expression of exhaustion markers on T-cells from patients with NFKBIE-mutated CLL. In addition, we show that NFKBIE-mutated murine CLL cells display selective resistance to ibrutinib and report inferior outcomes to ibrutinib treatment in NFKBIE-mutated CLL patients. These findings suggest that NFKBIE mutations can contribute to CLL progression through multiple mechanisms, including a bidirectional crosstalk with the microenvironment and reduced sensitivity to BTK inhibitor treatment.},

  abstract = {Diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is the most common hematological malignancy and is one of the most frequent non-Hodgkin lymphomas. Large-scale genomic studies have defined genetic drivers of DLBCL and their association with functional and clinical outcomes. However, the lymphomagenesis of DLBCL is yet to be fully understood. In the present study, four computational tools OncodriveFM, OncodriveCLUST, integrated Cancer Genome Score and Driver Genes and Pathways were used to detect driver genes and driver pathways involved in DLBCL. The aforementioned tools were also used to perform an integrative investigation of driver genes, including co-expression network, protein-protein interaction, copy number variation and survival analyses. The present study identified 208 driver genes and 31 driver pathways in DLBCL. IGLL5, MLL2, BTG2, B2M, PIM1, CARD11 were the top five frequently mutated genes in DLBCL. NOTCH3, LAMC1, COL4A1, PDGFRB and KDR were the 5 hub genes in the blue module that were associated with patient age. TP53, MYC, EGFR, PTEN, IL6, STAT3, MAPK8, TNF and CDH1 were at the core of the protein-protein interaction network. PRDM1, CDKN2A, CDKN2B, TNFAIP3, RSPO3 were the top five frequently deleted driver genes in DLBCL, while ACTB, BTG2, PLET1, CARD11, DIXDC1 were the top five frequently amplified driver genes in DLBCL. High EIF3B, MLH1, PPP1CA and RECQL4 expression was associated with decreased overall survival rate of patients with DLBCL. High XPO1 and LYN expression were associated with increased overall survival rate of patients with DLBCL.

Germinal center B-cell (GCB)-like diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), follicular lymphoma (FL) and Burkitt's lymphoma (BL) each share molecular similarities with normal GCB cells. Recent next-generation sequencing studies have gained insight into the genetic etiology of these malignancies and revealed a high frequency of mutations within genes encoding proteins that modifying chromatin. These include activating and inactivating mutations of genes that perform post-translational modification of histones and organize chromatin structure. Here, we discuss the function of histone acetyltransferases (CREBBP, EP300), histone methyltransferases (KDM2C/D, EZH2) and regulators of higher order chromatin structure (HIST1H1C/D/E, ARID1A and SMARCA4) that have been reported to be mutated in ⩾5\% of DLBCL, FL or BL. Mutations of these genes are an emerging hallmark of lymphomas with GCB-cell origins, and likely represent the next generation of therapeutic targets for these malignancies.},

Using the cBioPortal database we show that human actins are infrequently mutated in patient samples of various cancers types. Nevertheless, ranking these studies by mutational frequency suggest that some have a higher percentage of patients with ACTB and ACTG1 mutations. Within studies on hematological cancers, mutations in ACTB and ACTG1 are associated with lymphoid cancers since none have currently been reported in myeloid cancers. Within the different types of lymphoid cancers ACTB mutations are most frequent in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and ACTG1 mutations in multiple myeloma. We mapped the ACTB and ACTG1 mutations found in these two cancer types on the 3D-structure of actin showing they are in regions important for actin polymer formation or binding to myosin. The potential effects of the mutations on actin properties imply that mutations in cytoplasmic actins deserve dedicated research in DLBCL and multiple myeloma.},

  abstract = {Activated B cell-like diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (ABC-DLBCL) have unfavorable outcomes and chronic activation of CARD11-BCL10-MALT1 (CBM) signal amplification complexes that form due to polymerization of BCL10 subunits, which is affected by recurrent somatic mutations in ABC-DLBCLs. Herein, we show that BCL10 mutants fall into at least two functionally distinct classes: missense mutations of the BCL10 CARD domain and truncation of its C-terminal tail. Truncating mutations abrogated a motif through which MALT1 inhibits BCL10 polymerization, trapping MALT1 in its activated filament-bound state. CARD missense mutations enhanced BCL10 filament formation, forming glutamine network structures that stabilize BCL10 filaments. Mutant forms of BCL10 were less dependent on upstream CARD11 activation and thus manifested resistance to BTK inhibitors, whereas BCL10 truncating but not CARD mutants were hypersensitive to MALT1 inhibitors. Therefore, BCL10 mutations are potential biomarkers for BTK inhibitor resistance in ABC-DLBCL, and further precision can be achieved by selecting therapy based on specific biochemical effects of distinct mutation classes. SIGNIFICANCE: ABC-DLBCLs feature frequent mutations of signaling mediators that converge on the CBM complex. We use structure-function approaches to reveal that BCL10 mutations fall into two distinct biochemical classes. Both classes confer resistance to BTK inhibitors, whereas BCL10 truncations confer hyperresponsiveness to MALT1 inhibitors, providing a road map for precision therapies in ABC-DLBCLs.

SMARCA4 is among the most recurrently mutated genes in human cancer, including ∼30\% of germinal center (GC)-derived Burkitt lymphomas. In mice, GC-specific Smarca4 haploinsufficiency cooperated with MYC over-expression to drive lymphomagenesis. Furthermore, monoallelic Smarca4 deletion drove GC hyperplasia with centroblast polarization via significantly increased rates of centrocyte recycling to the dark zone. Mechanistically, Smarca4 loss reduced the activity of TFs that are activated in centrocytes to drive GC-exit, including SPI1 (PU.1), IRF family, and NF-κB. Loss of activity for these factors phenocopied aberrant BCL6 activity within murine centrocytes and human Burkitt lymphoma cells. SMARCA4 therefore facilitates chromatin accessibility for TFs that shape centrocyte trajectories, and loss of fine-control of these programs biases toward centroblast cell-fate, GC hyperplasia and lymphoma.},

In this study, we performed whole-genome and transcriptome sequencing, and a genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9-knockout screen to study an activated B-cell-like DLBCL cell line (RC-K8). We identified a distinct pattern of genetic essentialities in RC-K8, including a dependency on CREBBP and MDM2. The dependency on CREBBP is associated with a balanced translocation involving EP300, which results in a truncated form of the protein that lacks the critical histone acetyltransferase (HAT) domain. The synthetic lethal interaction between CREBBP and EP300 genes, two frequently mutated epigenetic modulators in B-cell lymphoma, was further validated in the previously published CRISPR-Cas9 screens and inhibitor assays. Our study suggests that integration of the unbiased functional screen results with genomic and transcriptomic data can identify both common and unique druggable vulnerabilities in DLBCL and histone acetyltransferases inhibition could be a therapeutic option for CREBBP or EP300 mutated cases.},

Using in vitro and in vivo models, we found that inhibition of CARM1 activity (CARM1i) slows DLBCL growth, and that the levels of sensitivity are positively correlated with the CREBBP/EP300 mutation load. Conversely, treatment of DLBCLs that do not have CREBBP/EP300 mutations with CARM1i and a CBP/p300 inhibitor revealed a strong synergistic effect. Our mechanistic data show that CARM1i further reduces the HAT activity of CBP genome wide and downregulates CBP-target genes in DLBCL cells, resulting in a synthetic lethality that leverages the mutational status of CREBBP/EP300 as a biomarker for the use of small-molecule inhibitors of CARM1 in DLBCL and other cancers.},

Heterozygosity and the presence of equal quantities of both mutant and wild-type mRNA and expressed protein suggest a dominant mode of action. Surprisingly, B-cell lymphoma cell lines and lymphoma samples harboring heterozygous EZH2(Y641) mutations have increased levels of histone H3 Lys-27-specific trimethylation (H3K27me3). Expression of EZH2(Y641F/N) mutants in cells with EZH2(WT) resulted in an increase of H3K27me3 levels in vivo. Structural modeling of EZH2(Y641) mutants suggests a "Tyr/Phe switch" model whereby structurally neutral, nontyrosine residues at position 641 would decrease affinity for unmethylated and monomethylated H3K27 substrates and potentially favor trimethylation. We demonstrate, using in vitro enzyme assays of reconstituted PRC2 complexes, that Y641 mutations result in a decrease in monomethylation and an increase in trimethylation activity of the enzyme relative to the wild-type enzyme. This represents the first example of a disease-associated gain-of-function mutation in a histone methyltransferase, whereby somatic EZH2 Y641 mutations in lymphoma act dominantly to increase, rather than decrease, histone methylation. The dominant mode of action suggests that allele-specific EZH2 inhibitors should be a future therapeutic strategy for this disease.},

The analysis of LP cells for selected mutations of the DLBCL revealed that most mutations are also present in the LP cells, indicating a close relationship between the two components. The analysis of 62 selected genes in NLPHL by targeted ultra-deep sequencing revealed three novel highly recurrently mutated genes (each mutated in \textasciitilde 50\% of cases), that is, DUSP2, SGK1 and JUNB. SGK1 was expressed in the LP cells of primary NLPHL cases and in the NLPHL cell line DEV.

Despite differences in tumor microenvironment and clinical behavior, the tumor cells of both entities show remarkable similarities, suggesting that both lymphomas might represent a spectrum of the same disease. To address this issue, we investigated whether these entities share mutations. Ultra-deep targeted resequencing of six typical and 11 histopathological variants of nodular lymphocyte-predominant Hodgkin lymphoma, and nine cases of T-cell/histiocyte-rich large B-cell lymphoma revealed that genes recurrently mutated in nodular lymphocyte-predominant Hodgkin lymphoma are affected by mutations at similar frequencies in T-cell/histiocyte-rich large B-cell lymphoma. The most recurrently mutated genes were JUNB, DUSP2, SGK1, SOCS1 and CREBBP, which harbored mutations more frequently in T-cell/histiocyte-rich large B-cell lymphoma and the histopathological variants of nodular lymphocyte-predominant Hodgkin lymphoma than in its typical form. Mutations in JUNB, DUSP2, SGK1 and SOCS1 were highly enriched for somatic hypermutation hotspot sites, suggesting an important role of aberrant somatic hypermutation in the generation of these somatic mutations and thus in the pathogenesis of both lymphoma entities. Mutations in JUNB are generally rarely observed in malignant lymphomas and thus are relatively specific for nodular lymphocyte-predominant Hodgkin lymphoma and T-cell/histiocyte-rich large B-cell lymphoma at such high frequencies (5/17 and 5/9 cases with JUNB mutations, respectively). Taken together, the findings of the present study further support a close relationship between T-cell/histiocyte-rich large B-cell lymphoma and nodular lymphocyte-predominant Hodgkin lymphoma by showing that they share highly recurrent genetic lesions.},

A phase III trial ("Phoenix;" ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01855750) showed a survival benefit of ibrutinib addition to R-CHOP chemotherapy in younger patients with non-GCB DLBCL, but the molecular basis for this benefit was unclear. Analysis of biopsies from Phoenix trial patients revealed three previously characterized genetic subtypes of DLBCL: MCD, BN2, and N1. The 3-year event-free survival of younger patients (age ≤60 years) treated with ibrutinib plus R-CHOP was 100\% in the MCD and N1 subtypes while the survival of patients with these subtypes treated with R-CHOP alone was significantly inferior (42.9\% and 50\%, respectively). This work provides a mechanistic understanding of the benefit of ibrutinib addition to chemotherapy, supporting its use in younger patients with non-GCB DLBCL.},

  abstract = {Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is the most common aggressive lymphoma and constitutes a highly heterogenous disease. Recent comprehensive genomic profiling revealed the identity of numerous molecularly defined DLBCL subtypes, including a cluster which is characterized by recurrent aberrations in MYD88, CD79B, and BCL2, as well as various lesions promoting a block in plasma cell differentiation, including PRDM1, TBL1XR1, and SPIB. Here, we generated a series of autochthonous mouse models to mimic this DLBCL cluster and specifically focused on the impact of Cd79b mutations in this setting. We show that canonical Cd79b immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM) mutations do not accelerate Myd88- and BCL2-driven lymphomagenesis. Cd79b-mutant murine DLBCL were enriched for IgM surface expression, reminiscent of their human counterparts. Moreover, Cd79b-mutant lymphomas displayed a robust formation of cytoplasmic signaling complexes involving MYD88, CD79B, MALT1, and BTK. These~complexes were disrupted upon pharmacological BTK inhibition. The BTK inhibitor-mediated disruption of these signaling complexes translated into a selective ibrutinib sensitivity of lymphomas harboring combined Cd79b and Myd88 mutations. Altogether, this in-depth cross-species comparison provides a framework for the development of molecularly targeted therapeutic intervention strategies in DLBCL.},

  abstract = {Multiple immunomodulatory pathways shape the development of anti-tumor immune responses to lymphoid malignancies. We previously defined the recurrent genetic alterations in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and identified associated substructure and additional potential genetic bases for immune escape. CD70 was the most commonly perturbed immune response pathway component in our cohort of primary DLBCLs; alterations included inactivating mutations and copy loss. CD70 co-stimulation of CD27+ T cells induces antigen-dependent T-cell expansion and immune surveillance of normal and malignant B cells. Given the frequent co-association of CD70 alterations and BCL6 translocations in our DLBCL patient series, we assessed the consequences of Cd70 deficiency on Bcl6-driven lymphomagenesis in a murine model. We crossed previously generated Cd70−/- and Bcl6tg/+ mice to obtain Cd70−/−; Bcl6tg/+ animals. In our aging cohorts, Cd70−/−; Bcl6tg/+ mice developed significantly increased numbers of histopathologically confirmed DLBCLs at earlier timepoints, compared to Bcl6tg/+ animals. Both the Cd70−/−; Bcl6tg/+ and Bcl6tg/+ mice that were euthanized for symptoms exhibited massive splenomegaly and lymphomatous splenic infiltration. None of the wild-type (WT) and Cd70−/- animals developed lymphoma. To characterize potential differences in anti-tumor responses in Cd70−/−; Bcl6tg/+ versus Bcl6tg/+ mice, we harvested spleens from asymptomatic animals in each cohort at 6, 14 and 18 months (mo). Cd70−/−; Bcl6tg/+ mice exhibited significantly earlier onset splenomegaly than Bcl6tg/+ animals (both in comparison with WT mice). We performed single cell RNA sequencing of splenic cell suspensions from each murine cohort at the above-mentioned predetermined timepoints (6, 14 and 18 mo) and describe genotype-related changes in splenic CD8+ T-cell infiltration in this abstract. Our study revealed an age-related decline in the percentages of naive CD8+ T cells in all genotypes, with more striking and earlier changes in Cd70−/−; Bcl6tg/+ animals. Cd70−/−; Bcl6tg/+ and Bcl6tg/+ mice exhibited a selective and significant expansion of CD8+ cytotoxic T cells (CTLs), which expressed Gzmb and Prf1 and the exhaustion markers, Pdcd1, Lag3, Tigit, Tox and Tim3, and exhibited clonal expansion. At 6 mo, prior to splenic enlargement and the development of symptoms, CD8+ CTLs in Cd70−/−; Bcl6tg/+ animals expressed significantly higher levels of exhaustion markers than those in Bcl6tg/+ mice. Consistent with this finding, there was a more limited expansion and a subsequent contraction of these splenic CD8+ CTLs in Cd70−/−; Bcl6tg/+ mice, in comparison to Bcl6tg/+ animals. Taken together, these findings suggest that initial anti-tumor immune responses are less effective in Cd70−/−; Bcl6tg/+ mice than in Bcl6tg/+ animals and highlight the likely importance of CD70/CD27 co-stimulation in CD8+ T-cell response to Bcl6-driven DLBCL.Citation Format: Elisa Mandato, Eleonora Calabretta, Gali Bai, Li Song, Yanbo Sun, Vignesh Shanmugam, Julia Paczkowska, Il-Kyu Choi, Robert Redd, Ming Tang, Lee N Lawton, Donna Neuberg, Scott Rodig, Franziska Michor, Baochun Zhang, Margaret A Shipp. Cd70 genetic perturbation limits the development of an effective CD8+ T-cell immune response to Bcl6-driven diffuse large B-cell lymphoma [abstract].

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: CD70 is a costimulatory molecule that is transiently expressed on a small set of activated lymphocytes and is involved in T-cell-mediated immunity. However, the role of CD70 in B-cell malignancies remains controversial. METHODS: We investigated the clinical relevance of CD70 genetic alterations and its protein expression in two diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) cohorts with different ethnic backgrounds. We also performed transcriptomic analysis to explore the role of CD70 alterations in tumour microenvironment. We further tested the blockade of CD70 in combination with PD-L1 inhibitor in a murine lymphoma model. RESULTS: We showed that CD70 genetic aberrations occurred more frequently in the Chinese DLBCL cohort (56/233, 24.0\%) than in the Swedish cohort (9/84, 10.8\%), especially in those with concomitant hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. The CD70 genetic changes in DLBCL resulted in a reduction/loss of protein expression and/or CD27 binding, which might impair T cell priming and were independently associated with poor overall survival. Paradoxically, we observed that over-expression of CD70 protein was also associated with a poor treatment response, as well as an advanced disease stage and EBV infection. More exhausted CD8+ T cells were furthermore identified in CD70 high-expression DLBCLs. Finally, in a murine lymphoma model, we demonstrated that blocking the CD70/CD27 and/or PD1/PD-L1 interactions could reduce CD70+ lymphoma growth in vivo, by directly impairing the tumour cell proliferation and rescuing the exhausted T cells. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that CD70 can play a role in either tumour suppression or oncogenesis in DLBCL, likely via distinct immune evasion mechanisms, that is, impairing T cell priming or inducing T cell exhaustion. Characterisation of specific dysfunction of CD70 in DLBCL may thus provide opportunities for the development of novel targeted immuno-therapeutic strategies.},

  abstract = {Background: Patients with mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) follow a heterogeneous clinical course. While they generally require treatment initiation shortly after diagnosis, it is unclear whether deferring treatment in selected patients with an indolent clinical behavior affects their overall outcome. Patients and methods: In this population-based study, all patients diagnosed with MCL during 1998-2014 were identified in the British Columbia Cancer Agency Lymphoid Cancer Database. The associations between clinico-pathologic characteristics, including the expression of Ki67, SOX11, and TP53, and time to treatment (TtT) and OS were analyzed. Results: A total of 440 patients with MCL were evaluated: 365 (83\%) received early treatment and 75 (17\%) were observed ≥3\,months. In the observation group, 54 (72\%) patients had a nodal presentation, 16 (21\%) a non-nodal presentation, and 5 (7\%) had only gastrointestinal involvement. Characteristics associated with deferred treatment included good performance status, no B symptoms, low LDH, non-bulky disease, non-blastoid morphology, and lower Ki67 values. The median TtT in the observation group was 35\,months (range 5-79), and 60 (80\%) patients were observed beyond 12\,months. The median OS was significantly longer in the observation group than in the early treatment group (72 versus 52.5\,months, respectively, P\,=\,0.041). In multivariable analysis, treatment decision was not associated with OS [HR 0.804 (95\% CI 0.529-1.221), P\,=\,0.306]. Conclusions: A subgroup of patients with MCL may be safely observed from diagnosis without negatively impacting their outcomes, including patients with non-nodal presentation as well as asymptomatic patients with low burden nodal presentation and a low proliferative rate.},

  abstract = {The ubiquitin-proteasome system is a major regulatory pathway of protein degradation and plays an important role in cellular division. Fbxw7 (or hCdc4), a member of the F-box family of proteins, which are substrate recognition components of the multisubunit ubiquitin ligase SCF (Skp1-Cdc53/Cullin-F-box-protein), has been shown to mediate the ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis of several oncoproteins including cyclin E1, c-Myc, c-Jun, and Notch. The oncogenic potential of Fbxw7 substrates, frequent allelic loss in human cancers, and demonstration that mutation of FBXW7 cooperates with p53 in mouse tumorigenesis have suggested that Fbxw7 could function as a tumor suppressor in human cancer. Here, we carry out an extensive genetic screen of primary tumors to evaluate the role of FBXW7 as a tumor suppressor in human tumorigenesis. Our results indicate that FBXW7 is inactivated by mutation in diverse human cancer types with an overall mutation frequency of ∼6\%. The highest mutation frequencies were found in tumors of the bile duct (cholangiocarcinomas, 35\%), blood (T-cell acute lymphocytic leukemia, 31\%), endometrium (9\%), colon (9\%), and stomach (6\%). Approximately 43\% of all mutations occur at two mutational “hotspots,” which alter Arg residues (Arg465 and Arg479) that are critical for substrate recognition. Furthermore, we show that Fbxw7Arg465 hotspot mutant can abrogate wild-type Fbxw7 function through a dominant negative mechanism. Our study is the first comprehensive screen of FBXW7 mutations in various human malignancies and shows that FBXW7 is a general tumor suppressor in human cancer. [Cancer Res 2007;67(19):9006–12]},

Although large comprehensive sequence data sets continue to be made increasingly available, data analysis remains an ongoing challenge, particularly for laboratories lacking dedicated resources and bioinformatics expertise. To address this, we have produced a collection of Galaxy tools that represent many popular algorithms for detecting somatic genetic alterations from cancer genome and exome data. We developed new methods for parallelization of these tools within Galaxy to accelerate runtime and have demonstrated their usability and summarized their runtimes on multiple cloud service providers. Some tools represent extensions or refinement of existing toolkits to yield visualizations suited to cohort-wide cancer genomic analysis. For example, we present Oncocircos and Oncoprintplus, which generate data-rich summaries of exome-derived somatic mutation. Workflows that integrate these to achieve data integration and visualizations are demonstrated on a cohort of 96 diffuse large B-cell lymphomas and enabled the discovery of multiple candidate lymphoma-related genes. Our toolkit is available from our GitHub repository as Galaxy tool and dependency definitions and has been deployed using virtualization on multiple platforms including Docker.},

  abstract = {Liquid biopsies are rapidly emerging as powerful tools for the early detection of cancer, noninvasive genomic profiling of localized or metastatic tumors, prompt detection of treatment resistance-associated mutations, and monitoring of therapeutic response and minimal residual disease in patients during clinical follow-up. Growing evidence strongly supports the utility of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) as a biomarker for the stratification and clinical management of lymphoma patients. However, ctDNA is diluted by variable amounts of cell-free DNA (cfDNA) shed by nonneoplastic cells causing a background signal of wild-type DNA that limits the sensitivity of methods that rely on DNA sequencing. Here, we describe an error suppression method for single-molecule counting that relies on targeted sequencing of cfDNA libraries constructed with semi-degenerate barcode adapters. Custom pools of biotinylated DNA baits for target enrichment can be designed to specifically track somatic mutations in one patient, survey mutation hotspots with diagnostic and prognostic value or be comprised of comprehensive gene panels with broad patient coverage in lymphoma. Such methods are amenable to track ctDNA levels during longitudinal liquid biopsy testing with high specificity and sensitivity and characterize, in real time, the genetic profiles of tumors without the need of standard invasive biopsies. The analysis of ultra-deep sequencing data according to the bioinformatics pipelines also described in this chapter affords to harness lower limits of detection for ctDNA below 0.1\%.},

  abstract = {Molecular heterogeneity of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) underlies the variable outcomes achieved with immunochemotherapy. However, outcomes of gene expression profiling (GEP)–defined molecular subgroups in a real-world DLBCL population remain unknown. Here we examined the prevalence and outcomes of molecular subgroups in an unselected population of 1149 patients with de novo DLBCL in British Columbia, Canada. Evaluable biopsies were profiled by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), immunohistochemistry, and digital GEP to assign cell-of-origin and the so-called “double-hit signature” (DHITsig)—a signature originally described as being characteristic for high-grade B-cell lymphoma with MYC and BCL2 rearrangements (HGBCL-DH-BCL2). DHITsig was expressed in 21\% of 431 germinal center B-cell-like (GCB)–DLBCL and all 55 Burkitt lymphomas examined. Reflecting this latter finding, DHITsig has been renamed the “dark zone signature” (DZsig). DZsigpos-DLBCL, non-DZsigpos GCB-DLBCL and activated B-cell-like (ABC)–DLBCL were associated with a 2 year overall survival of 57\%, 89\%, and 71\%, respectively. 62\% of DZsigpos tumors were negative for HGBCL-DH-BCL2 by FISH, but were associated with outcomes similar to HGBCL-DH-BCL2. A small group of HGBCL-DH-BCL2 that lacked DZsig expression had different molecular features compared with DZsig-expressing HGBCL-DH-BCL2 and were associated with favorable outcomes comparable to DLBCL, not otherwise specified. DZsigpos and ABC-DLBCL had a shorter diagnosis-to-treatment interval (DTI) than GCB-DLBCL, with this metric being associated with outcome. In conclusion, DZsig expression extends beyond HGBCL-DH-BCL2 and captures a poor-prognosis DLBCL subgroup with short DTI, including patients unidentifiable by routine FISH testing, that should be considered for treatment intensification or novel therapies in prospective trials.}

In this paper, we propose a new Bayesian hierarchical model to overcome these problems in a relatively straightforward way. In particular, we propose a new Bayesian Lasso method that employs a skewed Laplace distribution for the errors and a scaled mixture of uniform distribution for the regression parameters, together with Bayesian MCMC estimation. Comprehensive comparisons between our proposed gene selection method and other competitor methods are performed experimentally, depending on four benchmark gene expression datasets. The experimental results prove that the proposed method is very effective for selecting the most relevant genes with high classification accuracy.},

  abstract = {The analysis of population structure has many applications in medical and population genetic research. Such analysis is used to provide clear insight into the underlying genetic population substructure and is a crucial prerequisite for any analysis of genetic data. The analysis involves grouping individuals into subpopulations based on shared genetic variations. The most widely used markers to study the variation of DNA sequences between populations are single nucleotide polymorphisms. Data preprocessing is a necessary step to assess the quality of the data and to determine which markers or individuals can reasonably be included in the analysis. After preprocessing, several methods can be utilized to uncover population substructure, which can be categorized into two broad approaches: parametric and nonparametric. Parametric approaches use statistical models to infer population structure and assign individuals into subpopulations. However, these approaches suffer from many drawbacks that make them impractical for large datasets. In contrast, nonparametric approaches do not suffer from these drawbacks, making them more viable than parametric approaches for analyzing large datasets. Consequently, nonparametric approaches are increasingly used to reveal population substructure. Thus, this paper reviews and discusses the nonparametric approaches that are available for population structure analysis along with some implications to resolve challenges.},

By contrast, liquid biopsies show promise for molecular profiling of cHL due to relatively high circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA) levels1-4. Here we show that the plasma representation of mutations exceeds the bulk tumour representation in most cases, making cHL particularly amenable to noninvasive profiling. Leveraging single-cell transcriptional profiles of cHL tumours, we demonstrate Hodgkin and Reed-Sternberg ctDNA shedding to be shaped by DNASE1L3, whose increased tumour microenvironment-derived expression drives high ctDNA concentrations. Using this insight, we comprehensively profile 366 patients, revealing two distinct cHL genomic subtypes with characteristic clinical and prognostic correlates, as well as distinct transcriptional and immunological profiles. Furthermore, we identify a novel class of truncating IL4R mutations that are dependent on IL-13 signalling and therapeutically targetable with IL-4Rα-blocking antibodies. Finally, using PhasED-seq5, we demonstrate the clinical value of pretreatment and on-treatment ctDNA levels for longitudinally refining cHL risk prediction and for detection of radiographically occult minimal residual disease. Collectively, these results support the utility of noninvasive strategies for genotyping and dynamic monitoring of cHL, as well as capturing molecularly distinct subtypes with diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic potential.},

Most of these genes are only partially characterized and the functions of the vast majority are as yet unknown. It is likely that many genes that might be useful for diagnosis and/or prognostication of human malignancies have yet to be recognized. The advent of cDNA microarray technology now allows the efficient measurement of expression for almost every gene in the human genome in a single overnight hybridization experiment. This genomic scale approach has begun to reveal novel molecular-based sub-classes of tumours in breast carcinoma, colon carcinoma, lymphoma, leukaemia, and melanoma. In several instances, gene microarray analysis has already identified genes that appear to be useful for predicting clinical behaviour. This review discusses some recent findings using gene microarray technology and describes how this and related technologies are likely to contribute to the emergence of novel molecular classifications of human malignancies.},

To address this, we performed a mutation significance study of over 1,000 melanoma exomes, combined with a multi-omic analysis of 470 cases from The Cancer Genome Atlas. We discovered several SMGs with co-occurring loss-of-heterozygosity and loss-of-function mutations, including PBRM1, PLXNC1 and PRKAR1A, which encodes a protein kinase A holoenzyme subunit. Deconvolution of bulk tumor transcriptomes into cancer, immune and stromal components revealed a melanoma-intrinsic oxidative phosphorylation signature associated with protein kinase A pathway alterations. We also identified SMGs on the X chromosome, including the RNA helicase DDX3X, whose loss-of-function mutations were exclusively observed in males. Finally, we found that tumor mutation burden and immune infiltration contain complementary information on survival of patients with melanoma. In summary, our multi-omic analysis provides insights into melanoma etiology and supports contribution of specific mutations to the sex bias observed in this cancer.},

Using the GFP tag for immunopurification of mRNPs, mRNA targets of SRp20 and SRp75 were identified in cycling and neurally induced P19 cells. Genome-wide analysis showed that SRp20 and SRp75 associate with hundreds of distinct, functionally related groups of transcripts that change in response to neural differentiation. Knockdown of either SRp20 or SRp75 led to up- or downregulation of specific transcripts, including identified targets, and rescue by the GFP-tagged SR proteins proved their functionality. Thus, SR proteins contribute to the execution of gene-expression programs through their association with distinct endogenous mRNAs.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The SR proteins comprise a family of essential, structurally related RNA binding proteins. The complexity of their RNA targets and specificity of RNA recognition in vivo is not well understood. Here we use iCLIP to globally analyze and compare the RNA binding properties of two SR proteins, SRSF3 and SRSF4, in murine cells. RESULTS: SRSF3 and SRSF4 binding sites mapped to largely non-overlapping target genes, and in vivo consensus binding motifs were distinct. Interactions with intronless and intron-containing mRNAs as well as non-coding RNAs were detected. Surprisingly, both SR proteins bound to the 3' ends of the majority of intronless histone transcripts, implicating SRSF3 and SRSF4 in histone mRNA metabolism. In contrast, SRSF3 but not SRSF4 specifically bound transcripts encoding numerous RNA binding proteins. Remarkably, SRSF3 was shown to modulate alternative splicing of its own as well as three other transcripts encoding SR proteins. These SRSF3-mediated splicing events led to downregulation of heterologous SR proteins via nonsense-mediated decay. CONCLUSIONS: SRSF3 and SRSF4 display unique RNA binding properties underlying diverse cellular regulatory mechanisms, with shared as well as unique coding and non-coding targets. Importantly, CLIP analysis led to the discovery that SRSF3 cross-regulates the expression of other SR protein family members.},

  abstract = {RNA binding protein PCBP1 guards effector and antitumor T cell functions., Distinct lineages of T cells can act in response to various environmental cues to either drive or restrict immune-mediated pathology. Here, we identify the RNA binding protein, poly(C)-binding protein 1 (PCBP1) as an intracellular immune checkpoint that is up-regulated in activated T cells to prevent conversion of effector T (Teff) cells into regulatory T (Treg) cells, by restricting the expression of Teff cell–intrinsic Treg commitment programs. This was critical for stabilizing Teff cell functions and subverting immune-suppressive signals. T cell–specific deletion of Pcbp1 favored Treg cell differentiation, enlisted multiple inhibitory immune checkpoint molecules including PD-1, TIGIT, and VISTA on tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, and blunted antitumor immunity. Our results demonstrate a critical role for PCBP1 as an intracellular immune checkpoint for maintaining Teff cell functions in cancer immunity.},

  abstract = {In dogs, Burkitt-like lymphoma (B-LL) is rare tumour and it is classified as a high-grade B-cell malignancy. The diagnosis is challenging because of the similar histologic appearance with other histotypes, no defined phenotypical criteria and poorly described clinical aspects. The aim of the study was to provide a detailed description of clinical and morphological features, as well as immunophenotypical profile of B-LL in comparison with the human counterpart. Thirteen dogs with histologically proven B-LL, for which a complete staging and follow-up were available, were retrospectively selected. Immunohistochemical expression of CD20, PAX5, CD3, CD10, BCL2, BCL6, MYC and caspase-3 was evaluated. Histologically, all B-LLs showed a diffuse architecture with medium to large-sized cells, high mitotic rate and diffuse starry sky appearance. B-phenotype of neoplastic cells was confirmed both by flow-cytometry and immunohistochemistry. Conversely, B-LLs were negative for BCL2 and MYC, whereas some cases co-expressed BCL6 and CD10, suggesting a germinal centre B-cell origin. Disease stage was advanced in the majority of cases. All dogs received CHOP-based chemotherapy with or without immunotherapy. Despite treatment, prognosis was poor, with a median time to progression and survival of 130 and 228 days, respectively. Nevertheless, approximately 30\% of dogs survived more than one year. An increased apoptotic index, a high turnover index and caspase-3 index correlated with shorter survival. In conclusion, canine B-LL shows phenotypical differences with the human counterpart along with features that might help to differentiate this entity from diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.},

  abstract = {MOTIVATION: Identification of the genomic alterations driving tumorigenesis is one of the main goals in oncogenomics research. Given the evolutionary principles of cancer development, computational methods that detect signals of positive selection in the pattern of tumor mutations have been effectively applied in the search for cancer genes. One of these signals is the abnormal clustering of mutations, which has been shown to be complementary to other signals in the detection of driver genes. RESULTS: We have developed OncodriveCLUSTL, a new sequence-based clustering algorithm to detect significant clustering signals across genomic regions. OncodriveCLUSTL is based on a local background model derived from the simulation of mutations accounting for the composition of tri- or penta-nucleotide context substitutions observed in the cohort under study. Our method can identify known clusters and bona-fide cancer drivers across cohorts of tumor whole-exomes, outperforming the existing OncodriveCLUST algorithm and complementing other methods based on different signals of positive selection. Our results indicate that OncodriveCLUSTL can be applied to the analysis of non-coding genomic elements and non-human mutations data. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: OncodriveCLUSTL is available as an installable Python 3.5 package.

Prognosis is strongly associated with molecular subgroup, although the driver mutations that distinguish the two main subgroups remain poorly defined. Through an integrative analysis of whole genomes, exomes, and transcriptomes, we have uncovered genes and non-coding loci that are commonly mutated in DLBCL. Our analysis has identified novel cis-regulatory sites, and implicates recurrent mutations in the 3' UTR of NFKBIZ as a novel mechanism of oncogene deregulation and NF-κB pathway activation in the activated B-cell (ABC) subgroup. Small amplifications associated with over-expression of FCGR2B (the Fcγ receptor protein IIB), primarily in the germinal centre B-cell (GCB) subgroup, correlate with poor patient outcomes suggestive of a novel oncogene. These results expand the list of subgroup driver mutations that may facilitate implementation of improved diagnostic assays and could offer new avenues for the development of targeted therapeutics.},

They can be generated using various experimental, theoretical, and computational techniques. The systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment which uses iterative screening of nucleic acid libraries is a popular experimental technique. Theory inspired methodology entropy-based seed-and-grow strategy that designs aptamer templates to bind specifically to targets is another one. Aptamers are predicted to be highly useful in producing general drugs and theranostic drugs occasionally for certain diseases like cancer, Alzheimer's disease, and so on. They bind to various targets like lipids, nucleic acids, proteins, small organic compounds, and even entire organisms. Aptamers may also serve as drug-carriers or nanoparticles helping drugs to get released in specific target regions. Due to better target specific physical binding properties aptamers cause less off-target toxicity effects. Therefore, search for aptamer based drugs, drug-carriers, and even diagnostic tools is expanding fast. The biophysical properties in relation to the target specific binding phenomena of aptamers, energetics behind the aptamer transport of drugs, and the consequent biological implications will be discussed. This review will open up avenues leading to novel drug discovery and drug delivery.},

Gene expression data are composed of dozens of samples characterized by thousands of genes. Hence, an accurate and effective classification of such samples is a challenge. Machine learning techniques have been broadly utilized to build substantial and precise classification models. This paper proposes a new classification technique for gene expression data, which is called Modified k-nearest neighbor (MKNN). MKNN is applied in two scenarios namely; smallest modified KNN (SMKNN) and largest modified KNN (LMKNN). Both implementations are undertaken to enhance the performance of KNN. The key idea is to employ robust neighbors from training data by using a new weighting strategy. Several experiments have been performed on six different gene expression datasets. Experiments have shown that MKNN in its both scenarios outperforms traditional as well as recent ones. MKNN has been compared against (i) KNN, (ii) weighted KNN, (iii) support vector machine (SVM), (iv) fuzzy support vector machine, (v) brain emotional learning (BEL) in terms of classification accuracy, precision, and recall. On the other hand, results show that MKNN introduces smaller testing time than both KNN and weighted KNN.},

  abstract = {Diffuse large B~cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is the most common B cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma and remains incurable in around 40\% of patients. Efforts to sequence the coding genome identified several genes and pathways that are altered in this disease, including potential therapeutic targets1-5. However, the non-coding genome of DLBCL remains largely unexplored. Here we show that active super-enhancers are highly and specifically hypermutated in 92\% of samples from individuals with DLBCL, display signatures of activation-induced cytidine deaminase activity, and are linked to genes that encode B cell developmental regulators and oncogenes. As evidence of oncogenic relevance, we show that the hypermutated super-enhancers linked to the BCL6, BCL2 and CXCR4 proto-oncogenes prevent the binding and transcriptional downregulation of the corresponding target gene by transcriptional repressors, including BLIMP1 (targeting BCL6) and the steroid receptor NR3C1 (targeting BCL2 and CXCR4). Genetic correction of selected mutations restored repressor DNA binding, downregulated target gene expression and led to the counter-selection of cells containing corrected alleles, indicating an oncogenic dependency on the super-enhancer mutations. This pervasive super-enhancer mutational mechanism reveals a major set of genetic lesions deregulating gene expression, which expands the involvement of known oncogenes in DLBCL pathogenesis and identifies new deregulated gene targets of therapeutic relevance.},

Through expression profiling and functional screening, we have identified that the large intergenic noncoding RNA p21 (lincRNA-p21) impairs reprogramming. Notably, lincRNA-p21 is induced by p53 but does not promote apoptosis or cell senescence in reprogramming. Instead, lincRNA-p21 associates with the H3K9 methyltransferase SETDB1 and the maintenance DNA methyltransferase DNMT1, which is facilitated by the RNA-binding protein HNRNPK. Consequently, lincRNA-p21 prevents reprogramming by sustaining H3K9me3 and/or CpG methylation at pluripotency gene promoters. Our results provide insight into the role of lncRNAs in reprogramming and establish a novel link between p53 and heterochromatin regulation.},

CTSS Y132 mutations lead to accelerated autocatalytic conversion from an enzymatically inactive profrom to active CTSS and increased substrate cleavage, including CD74, which regulates major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC class II)-restricted antigen presentation. Lymphoma cells with hyperactive CTSS more efficiently activated antigen-specific CD4+ T~cells in~vitro. Tumors with hyperactive CTSS showed increased CD4+ T~cell infiltration and proinflammatory cytokine perturbation in a mouse model and in human FLs. In mice, this CTSS-induced immune microenvironment promoted tumor growth. Clinically, patients with CTSS-hyperactive FL had better treatment outcomes with standard immunochemotherapies, indicating that these immunosuppressive regimens target both the lymphoma cells and the tumor-promoting immune microenvironment.},

While pharmacologic inhibition of autophagy with hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) is currently being explored in human clinical trials, it has never been evaluated in canine cancers. Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) is one of the most prevalent tumor types in dogs and has similar pathogenesis and response to treatment as human NHL. Clinical trials in canine patients are conducted in the same way as in human patients, thus, to determine a maximum dose of HCQ that can be combined with a standard chemotherapy, a Phase I, single arm, dose escalation trial was conducted in dogs with spontaneous NHL presenting as patients to an academic, tertiary-care veterinary teaching hospital. HCQ was administered daily by mouth throughout the trial, beginning 72 h prior to doxorubicin (DOX), which was given intravenously on a 21-d cycle. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells and biopsies were collected before and 3 d after HCQ treatment and assessed for autophagy inhibition and HCQ concentration. A total of 30 patients were enrolled in the trial. HCQ alone was well tolerated with only mild lethargy and gastrointestinal-related adverse events. The overall response rate (ORR) for dogs with lymphoma was 93.3\%, with median progression-free interval (PFI) of 5 mo. Pharmacokinetic analysis revealed a 100-fold increase in HCQ in tumors compared with plasma. There was a trend that supported therapy-induced increase in LC3-II (the cleaved and lipidated form of microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3/LC3, which serves as a maker for autophagosomes) and SQSTM1/p62 (sequestosome 1) after treatment. The superior ORR and comparable PFI to single-agent DOX provide strong support for further evaluation via randomized, placebo-controlled trials in canine and human NHL.},

  abstract = {BCL6 is a transcriptional repressor which has emerged as a critical regulator of germinal centers (GC), the sites where B cells are selected based on the production of antibodies with high affinity for the antigen. BCL6 is also a frequently activated oncogene in the pathogenesis of human B cell lymphomas, most of which derive from the GC B cells. A thorough understanding of the biological role of BCL6 in normal B cell development and lymphomagenesis depends upon the identification of the full set of genes that are targets of its transcriptional regulatory function. Recently, the identification of BCL6 targets has been implemented with the use of genome-wide chromatin immunoprecipitation and gene expression profiling approaches. A large set of promoters have been shown to be physically bound by BCL6, but only a fraction of them appears to be subjected to transcriptional repression in GC B cells. This set of BCL6 targets points to a number of cellular functions which are likely to be directly controlled by BCL6 during GC development, including activation, survival, DNA-damage response, cell cycle arrest, cytokine-, toll-like receptor-, TGFbeta-, WNT-signaling, and differentiation. Overall, BCL6 is revealing its dual role of "safe-keeper" in preventing centroblasts from responding to signals leading to a premature exit from the GC and of contributor to lymphomagenesis by allowing the instauration of conditions favorable to malignant transformation.},

  abstract = {BCL6 is a transcriptional repressor required in mature B cells during the germinal center (GC) reaction. Multiple mechanisms act coordinately to timely modulate BCL6 expression at transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels. BCL6 prevents premature activation and differentiation of GC B cells and provides an environment tolerant of the DNA breaks associated with immunoglobulin gene remodeling mechanisms involved in the production of high-affinity antibodies of different isotypes. The critical functions exerted by BCL6 during normal B-cell development can be hijacked by the malignant transformation process. Indeed, BCL6 is targeted by genetic aberrations and acts as an oncogene in GC-derived lymphomas. The aberrations affecting BCL6 interfere with the multiple levels of regulation that grant a fine tuning of BCL6 expression and activity in physiologic conditions. This review summarizes the current knowledge on BCL6 function and its role in lymphomagenesis.},

  abstract = {Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) is an aggressive tumor, but a subset of patients may follow an indolent clinical course. To understand the mechanisms underlying this biological heterogeneity, we performed whole-genome and/or whole-exome sequencing on 29 MCL cases and their respective matched normal DNA, as well as 6 MCL cell lines. Recurrently mutated genes were investigated by targeted sequencing in an independent cohort of 172 MCL patients. We identified 25 significantly mutated genes, including known drivers such as ataxia-telangectasia mutated (ATM), cyclin D1 (CCND1), and the tumor suppressor TP53; mutated genes encoding the anti-apoptotic protein BIRC3 and Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2); and the chromatin modifiers WHSC1, MLL2, and MEF2B. We also found NOTCH2 mutations as an alternative phenomenon to NOTCH1 mutations in aggressive tumors with a dismal prognosis. Analysis of two simultaneous or subsequent MCL samples by whole-genome/whole-exome (n = 8) or targeted (n = 19) sequencing revealed subclonal heterogeneity at diagnosis in samples from different topographic sites and modulation of the initial mutational profile at the progression of the disease. Some mutations were predominantly clonal or subclonal, indicating an early or late event in tumor evolution, respectively. Our study identifies molecular mechanisms contributing to MCL pathogenesis and offers potential targets for therapeutic intervention.},

  abstract = {Appropriate PI3K signals generated by the antigen receptor are essential to promote B cell development. Regulation of recombination activating gene (RAG)-1 and RAG-2 expression is one key process that is mediated by PI3K to ensure developmental progression and selection. When PI3K signals are too high or too low, expression of RAGs does not turn off and B cell development is impaired or blocked. Yet, the mechanism which tunes PI3K activity to control RAG expression during B cell development in the bone marrow is unknown. Recently we showed that a c-Myc/miR17-92/PTEN axis regulates PI3K activity for positive and negative selection of immature B cells. Here, we show that the c-Myc/miR17-92/PTEN axis tunes PI3K activity to control the expression of RAGs in proB cells. Using different genetically engineered mouse models we show that impaired function of the c-Myc/miR17-92/PTEN axis alters the PI3K/Akt/Foxo1 pathway to result in dis-regulated expression of RAG and a block in B cell development. Studies using 38c-13 B lymphoma cells, where RAGs are constitutively expressed, suggest that this regulatory effect is mediated post-translationally through Foxo1.},

  abstract = {A hallmark of classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL) is that the B-cell-derived Hodgkin and Reed-Sternberg (HRS) tumor cells have largely lost the B-cell-typical gene expression program. The factors causing this 'reprogramming' of HRS cells are only partly understood. As early B-cell factor 1 (EBF1), a major B-cell transcription factor, is downregulated in HRS cells, we analyzed whether this downregulation contributes to the lost B-cell phenotype and tested the consequences of EBF1 re-expression in cHL cell lines. EBF1 re-expression caused an upregulation of B-cell genes, such as CD19, CD79A and CD79B, although the B-cell genes FOXO1 and PAX5 remained lowly expressed. The re-expression of CD19, CD79A and CD79B occurred largely without demethylation of promoter CpG motifs of these genes. In the cHL cell line L-1236 fitness decreased after EBF1 re-expression. These data show that EBF1 has the ability to reintroduce part of the B-cell signature in cHL cell lines. Loss of EBF1 expression in HRS cells therefore contributes to their lost B-cell phenotype. Notably, in the cHL cell line KM-H2 destructive mutations were found in one allele of EBF1, indicating that genetic lesions may sometimes have a role in impairing EBF1 expression.},

  abstract = {Conventional chemotherapeutics remain essential treatments for most cancers, but their combination with other anticancer drugs (including targeted therapeutics) is often complicated by unpredictable synergies and multiplicative toxicities. As cytotoxic anticancer chemotherapeutics generally function through induction of apoptosis, we hypothesized that a molecularly targeted small molecule capable of facilitating a central and defining step in the apoptotic cascade, the activation of procaspase-3 to caspase-3, would broadly and predictably enhance activity of cytotoxic drugs. Here we show that procaspase-activating compound 1 (PAC-1) enhances cancer cell death induced by 15 different FDA-approved chemotherapeutics, across many cancer types and chemotherapeutic targets. In particular, the promising combination of PAC-1 and doxorubicin induces a synergistic reduction in tumor burden and enhances survival in murine tumor models of osteosarcoma and lymphoma. This PAC-1/doxorubicin combination was evaluated in 10 pet dogs with naturally occurring metastatic osteosarcoma or lymphoma, eliciting a biologic response in 3 of 6 osteosarcoma patients and 4 of 4 lymphoma patients. Importantly, in both mice and dogs, coadministration of PAC-1 with doxorubicin resulted in no additional toxicity. On the basis of the mode of action of PAC-1 and the high expression of procaspase-3 in many cancers, these results suggest the combination of PAC-1 with cytotoxic anticancer drugs as a potent and general strategy to enhance therapeutic response.},

We demonstrate that many MLL3 variant calls made by exome sequencing are false positives due to misalignment to homologous regions, including a region on chr21, and can only be validated by long-range PCR. Numerous other recurrently mutated genes reported in COSMIC and TCGA databases have pseudogenes and cannot also be validated by conventional short read-based sequencing approaches. Genome-wide identification of pseudogene regions demonstrates that frequency of these homologous regions is increased with sequencing read lengths below 200~bps. To enable identification of poor quality sequencing variants in prospective studies, we generated novel genome-wide maps of regions with poor mappability that can be used in variant calling algorithms. Taken together, our findings reveal that pseudogene regions are a source of false-positive mutations in cancers.},

  abstract = {Lymphoplasmacytic lymphomas and marginal zone lymphomas of nodal, extra-nodal and splenic types account for 10\% of non-Hodgkin lymphomas. They are similar at the cell differentiation level, sometimes making difficult to distinguish them from other indolent non-Hodgkin lymphomas. To better characterize their genetic basis, we performed array-based comparative genomic hybridization in 101 marginal zone lymphomas (46 MALT, 35 splenic and 20 nodal marginal zone lymphomas) and 13 lymphoplasmacytic lymphomas. Overall, 90\% exhibited copy-number abnormalities. Lymphoplasmacytic lymphomas demonstrated the most complex karyotype (median=7 copy-number abnormalities), followed by MALT (4), nodal (3.5) and splenic marginal zone lymphomas (3). A comparative analysis exposed a group of copy-number abnormalities shared by several or all the entities with few disease-specific abnormalities. Gain of chromosomes 3, 12 and 18 and loss of 6q23-q24 (TNFAIP3) were identified in all entities. Losses of 13q14.3 (MIRN15A-MIRN16-1) and 17p13.3-p12 (TP53) were found in lymphoplasmacytic and splenic marginal zone lymphomas; loss of 11q21-q22 (ATM) was found in nodal, splenic marginal zone and lymphoplasmacytic lymphomas and loss of 7q32.1-q33 was found in MALT, splenic and lymphoplasmacytic lymphomas. Abnormalities affecting the nuclear factor kappa B pathway were observed in 70\% of MALT and lymphoplasmacytic lymphomas and 30\% of splenic and nodal marginal zone lymphomas, suggesting distinct roles of this pathway in the pathogenesis/progression of these subtypes. Elucidation of the genetic alterations contributing to the pathogenesis of these lymphomas may guide to design-specific therapeutic approaches.},

  abstract = {The pathophysiological similarities shared by many forms of human and canine disease, combined with the sophisticated genomic resources now available for the dog, have placed ‘man’s best friend’ in a position of high visibility as a model system for a variety of biomedical concerns, including cancer. The importance of nonrandom cytogenetic abnormalities in human leukemia and lymphoma was recognized over 40~years ago, but the mechanisms of genome reorganization remain incompletely understood. The development of molecular cytogenetics, using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) technology, has played a significant role in our understanding of cancer biology by providing a means for ‘interrogating’ tumor cells for a variety of gross genetic changes in the form of either numerical or structural chromosome aberrations. Here, we have identified cytogenetic abnormalities in naturally occurring canine hematopoietic tumors that are evolutionarily conserved compared with those that are considered characteristic of the corresponding human condition. These data suggest that humans and dogs share an ancestrally retained pathogenetic basis for cancer and that cytogenetic evaluation of canine tumors may provide greater insight into the biology of tumorigenesis.},

  abstract = {Although recurrent somatic mutations in the splicing factor U2AF1 (also known as U2AF35) have been identified in multiple cancer types, the effects of these mutations on the cancer transcriptome have yet to be fully elucidated. Here, we identified splicing alterations associated with U2AF1 mutations across distinct cancers using DNA and RNA sequencing data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Using RNA-Seq data from 182 lung adenocarcinomas and 167 acute myeloid leukemias (AML), in which U2AF1 is somatically mutated in 3–4\% of cases, we identified 131 and 369 splicing alterations, respectively, that were significantly associated with U2AF1 mutation. Of these, 30 splicing alterations were statistically significant in both lung adenocarcinoma and AML, including three genes in the Cancer Gene Census, CTNNB1, CHCHD7, and PICALM. Cell line experiments expressing U2AF1 S34F in HeLa cells and in 293T cells provide further support that these altered splicing events are caused by U2AF1 mutation. Consistent with the function of U2AF1 in 3′ splice site recognition, we found that S34F/Y mutations cause preferences for CAG over UAG 3′ splice site sequences. This report demonstrates consistent effects of U2AF1 mutation on splicing in distinct cancer cell types.},

The latest discoveries reveal that BCL6 is also an important regulator of other specialized helper T-cell subsets within germinal centers, pre-germinal center events, and peripheral T-cells effector functions. Here, we review newly discovered roles for BCL6 in lymphocyte subsets residing within and outside of germinal centers, and discuss their implications with respect to the molecular mechanisms of BCL6 regulation and potential links to B and T-cell lymphomas.},

In both age groups, survival remains poor at relapse. Therefore, we conducted a comparative study in a large pediatric cohort, including 191 cases and 97 samples from adults. While TP53 and CCND3 mutation frequencies are not age related, samples from pediatric patients showed a higher frequency of mutations in ID3, DDX3X, ARID1A and SMARCA4, while several genes such as BCL2 and YY1AP1 are almost exclusively mutated in adult patients. An unbiased analysis reveals a transition of the mutational profile between 25 and 40 years of age. Survival analysis in the pediatric cohort confirms that TP53 mutations are significantly associated with higher incidence of relapse (25\,±\,4\% versus 6\,±\,2\%, p-value 0.0002). This identifies a promising molecular marker for relapse incidence in pediatric BL which will be used in future clinical trials.},

  abstract = {Purpose: Only one chemical class of topoisomerase I (TOP1) inhibitors is FDA approved, the camptothecins with irinotecan and topotecan widely used. Because of their limitations (chemical instability, drug efflux-mediated resistance, and diarrhea), novel TOP1 inhibitors are warranted. Indenoisoquinoline non-camptothecin topoisomerase I (TOP1) inhibitors overcome chemical instability and drug resistance that limit camptothecin use. Three indenoisoquinolines, LMP400 (indotecan), LMP776 (indimitecan), and LMP744, were examined in a phase I study for lymphoma-bearing dogs to evaluate differential efficacy, pharmacodynamics, toxicology, and pharmacokinetics. Experimental Design: Eighty-four client-owned dogs with lymphomas were enrolled in dose-escalation cohorts for each indenoisoquinoline, with an expansion phase for LMP744. Efficacy, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and target engagement were determined. Results: The MTDs were 17.5 mg/m2 for LMP 776 and 100 mg/m2 for LMP744; bone marrow toxicity was dose-limiting; up to 65 mg/m2 LMP400 was well-tolerated and MTD was not reached. None of the drugs induced notable diarrhea. Sustained tumor accumulation was observed for LMP744; γH2AX induction was demonstrated in tumors 2 and 6 hours after treatment; a decrease in TOP1 protein was observed in most lymphoma samples across all compounds and dose levels, which is consistent with the fact that tumor response was also observed at low doses LMP744. Objective responses were documented for all indenoisoquinolines; efficacy (13/19 dogs) was greatest for LMP744. Conclusions: These results demonstrate proof-of-mechanism for indenoisoquinoline TOP1 inhibitors supporting their further clinical development. They also highlight the value of the NCI Comparative Oncology Program (https://ccr.cancer.gov/Comparative-Oncology-Program) for evaluating novel therapies in immunocompetent pets with cancers.},

In contrast to the many genes whose mutation contributes to lymphomagenesis in humans, relatively little is known about the acquired genetic alterations that lead to canine B-cell lymphomas (cBCLs). We performed a survey of 84 canine NHL tumors to identify genes affected by somatic point mutations. We found mutations affecting TRAF3, which encodes a negative regulator of nuclear factor (NF)-κB, to be a common feature of cBCLs, with mutations observed in 44\% of tumors including a combination of somatic and rare germ-line variants. Overall, 30\% of the tumors contained ≥1 somatic TRAF3 mutation. The majority of mutations are predicted to cause loss of TRAF3 protein including those impacting reading frame and splicing. To determine whether TRAF3 loss might be relevant to human NHL, we also analyzed 148 human diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) tumors and identified loss of TRAF3 as a common event, affecting ∼9\% of DLBCLs, and reduced expression of TRAF3 among deleted cases. This study implicates mutations affecting NF-κB activity as a novel genetic commonality between human and canine NHLs and supports the potential utility of cBCLs with mutated TRAF3 as a model of the more aggressive activated B-cell subgroup of DLBCL.},

The problem is exacerbated by a lack of sufficient experimental detail in many publications, which impedes a reader’s ability to evaluate critically the quality of the results presented or to repeat the experiments.Content: The Minimum Information for Publication of Quantitative Real-Time PCR Experiments (MIQE) guidelines target the reliability of results to help ensure the integrity of the scientific literature, promote consistency between laboratories, and increase experimental transparency. MIQE is a set of guidelines that describe the minimum information necessary for evaluating qPCR experiments. Included is a checklist to accompany the initial submission of a manuscript to the publisher. By providing all relevant experimental conditions and assay characteristics, reviewers can assess the validity of the protocols used. Full disclosure of all reagents, sequences, and analysis methods is necessary to enable other investigators to reproduce results. MIQE details should be published either in abbreviated form or as an online supplement.Summary: Following these guidelines will encourage better experimental practice, allowing more reliable and unequivocal interpretation of qPCR results.}

  abstract = {Rearrangement of chromosomal bands 1q21–23 is one of the most frequent chromosomal aberrations observed in hematological malignancy. The genes affected by these rearrangements remain poorly characterized. Typically, 1q21–23 rearrangements arise during tumor evolution and accompany disease-specific chromosomal rearrangements such as t(14;18) (BCL2) and t(8;14) (MYC), where they are thus thought to play an important role in tumor progression. The pathogenetic basis of this 1q21–23-associated disease progression is currently unknown. In this setting, we surveyed our series of follicular lymphoma for evidence of recurring 1q21–23 breaks and identified three cases in which a t(14;18)(q32;q21) was accompanied by a novel balanced t(1;22)(q22;q11). Molecular cloning of the t(1;22) in a cell line (B593) derived from one of these cases and detailed fluorescent in situ hybridization mapping in the two remaining cases identified the FCGR2B gene, which encodes the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibition motif-bearing IgG Fc receptor, FcγRIIB, as the target gene of the t(1;22)(q22;q11). We demonstrate deregulation of FCGR2B leading to hyperexpression of FcγRIIb2 as the principal consequence of the t(1;22). This is evidence that IgG Fc receptors can be targets for deregulation through chromosomal translocation in lymphoma. It suggests that dysregulation of FCGR2B may play a role in tumor progression in follicular lymphoma.}

  abstract = {Since the publication of the Revised European-American Classification of Lymphoid Neoplasms in 1994, subsequent updates of the classification of lymphoid neoplasms have been generated through iterative international efforts to achieve broad consensus among hematopathologists, geneticists, molecular scientists, and clinicians. Significant progress has recently been made in the characterization of malignancies of the immune system, with many new insights provided by genomic studies. They have led to this proposal. We have followed the same process that was successfully used for the third and fourth editions of the World Health Organization Classification of Hematologic Neoplasms. The definition, recommended studies, and criteria for the diagnosis of many entities have been extensively refined. Some categories considered provisional have now been upgraded to definite entities. Terminology for some diseases has been revised to adapt nomenclature to the current knowledge of their biology, but these modifications have been restricted to well-justified situations. Major findings from recent genomic studies have impacted the conceptual framework and diagnostic criteria for many disease entities. These changes will have an impact on optimal clinical management. The conclusions of this work are summarized in this report as the proposed International Consensus Classification of mature lymphoid, histiocytic, and dendritic cell tumors.},

In p53 mutant tumors, cell cycle checkpoints are rewired, leading to dependency on the p38/MK2 pathway to survive DNA-damaging chemotherapy. Here we show that the RNA binding protein hnRNPA0 is the “successor” to p53 for checkpoint control. Like p53, hnRNPA0 is activated by a checkpoint kinase (MK2) and simultaneously controls both cell cycle checkpoints through distinct target mRNAs, but unlike p53 this is through the post-transcriptional stabilization of p27Kip1 and Gadd45α mRNAs. This pathway drives cisplatin resistance in lung cancer demonstrating the importance of post-transcriptional RNA control to chemotherapy response.,},

  abstract = {The molecular basis of cell signal-regulated alternative splicing at the 3′ splice site remains largely unknown. We isolated a protein kinase A-responsive ribonucleic acid (RNA) element from a 3′ splice site of the synaptosomal-associated protein 25 (Snap25) gene for forskolin-inhibited splicing during neuronal differentiation of rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cells. The element binds specifically to heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleo protein (hnRNP) K in a phosphatase-sensitive way, which directly competes with the U2 auxiliary factor U2AF65, an essential component of early spliceosomes. Transcripts with similarly localized hnRNP K target motifs upstream of alternative exons are enriched in genes often associated with neurological diseases. We show that such motifs upstream of the Runx1 exon 6 also bind hnRNP K, and importantly, hnRNP K is required for forskolin-induced repression of the exon. Interestingly, this exon encodes the peptide domain that determines the switch of the transcriptional repressor/activator activity of Runx1, a change known to be critical in specifying neuron lineages. Consistent with an important role of the target genes in neurons, knocking down hnRNP K severely disrupts forskolin-induced neurite growth. Thus, through hnRNP K, the neuronal differentiation stimulus forskolin targets a critical 3′ splice site component of the splicing machinery to control alternative splicing of crucial genes. This also provides a regulated direct competitor of U2AF65 for cell signal control of 3′ splice site usage.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Members of the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) H protein family, H, H′, F, and 2H9, are involved in pre-mRNA processing. We analyzed the assembly of these proteins from splicing extracts onto four RNA regulatory elements as follows: a high affinity hnRNP A1-binding site (WA1), a sequence involved in Rev-dependent export (p17gag INS), an exonic splicing silencer from the β-tropomyosin gene, and an intronic splicing regulator (downstream control sequence (DCS) from the c-\emph{src} gene. The entire family binds the WA1, instability (INS), and β-tropomyosin substrates, and the core-binding site for each is a run of three G residues followed by an A. Transfer of small regions containing this sequence to a substrate lacking hnRNP H binding activity is sufficient to promote binding of all family members. The c-\emph{src} DCS has been shown to assemble hnRNP H, not hnRNP F, from HeLa cell extracts, and we show that hnRNP 2H9 does not bind this element. The DCS contains five G residues followed by a C. Mutation of the C to an A changes the specificity of the DCS from a substrate that binds only hnRNP H/H′ to a binding site for all hnRNP H family members. We conclude that the sequence GGGA is recognized by all hnRNP H family proteins.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {The heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1 (hnRNP A1) is a versatile RNA-binding protein playing a critical role in alternative pre-mRNA splicing regulation in cancer. Emerging data have implicated hnRNP A1 as a central player in a splicing regulatory circuit involving its direct transcriptional control by c-Myc oncoprotein and the production of the constitutively active ligand-independent alternative splice variant of androgen receptor, AR-V7, which promotes castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). As there is an urgent need for effective CRPC drugs, targeting hnRNP A1 could, therefore, serve a dual purpose of preventing AR-V7 generation as well as reducing c-Myc transcriptional output. Herein, we report compound VPC-80051 as the first small molecule inhibitor of hnRNP A1 splicing activity discovered to date by using a computer-aided drug discovery approach. The inhibitor was developed to target the RNA-binding domain (RBD) of hnRNP A1. Further experimental evaluation demonstrated that VPC-80051 interacts directly with hnRNP A1 RBD and reduces AR-V7 messenger levels in 22Rv1 CRPC cell line. This study lays the groundwork for future structure-based development of more potent and selective small molecule inhibitors of hnRNP A1⁻RNA interactions aimed at altering the production of cancer-specific alternative splice isoforms.},

We herein show that BCL-XL expression is selectively advantageous to cancer cell populations even in the absence of pro-apoptotic pressure. In transformed human mammary epithelial cells BCL-XL favours full activation of signalling downstream of constitutively active RAS with which it interacts in a BH4-dependent manner. Comparative proteomic analysis and functional assays indicate that this is critical for RAS-induced expression of stemness regulators and maintenance of a cancer initiating cell (CIC) phenotype. Resistant cancer cells thus arise from a positive selection driven by BCL-XL modulation of RAS-induced self-renewal, and during which apoptotic resistance is not necessarily the directly selected trait., BCL-XL provides a survival advantage to cancer cells even in the absence of apoptotic pressures. In this study, the authors show that BCL-XL interacts with RAS in a BH4-dependent manner and regulates RAS-mediated activation of pathways involved in the stemness feature of breast cancer cells.},

Several reports implicate hnRNP K having a role in tumorigenesis, for instance hnRNP K increases transcription of the oncogene c-myc and hnRNP K expression is regulated by the p53/MDM 2 pathway. In this study comparing normal colon to colorectal cancer by proteomics, hnRNP K was identified as being overexpressed in this type of cancer. Immunohistochemistry with a monoclonal antibody to hnRNP K (which we developed) on colorectal cancer tissue microarray, confirmed that hnRNP K was overexpressed in colorectal cancer (P{$<$}0.001) and also showed that hnRNP K had an aberrant subcellular localisation in cancer cells. In normal colon hnRNP K was exclusively nuclear whereas in colorectal cancer the protein localised both in the cytoplasm and the nucleus. There were significant increases in both nuclear (P=0.007) and cytoplasmic (P=0.001) expression of hnRNP K in Dukes C tumours compared with early stage tumours. In Dukes C patient's good survival was associated with increased hnRNP K nuclear expression (P=0.0093). To elaborate on the recent observation that hnRNP K is regulated by p53, the expression profiles of these two proteins were also analysed. There was no correlation between hnRNP K and p53 expression, however, patients who presented tumours that were positive for hnRNP K and p53 had a poorer survival outcome (P=0.045).},

  abstract = {Despite remarkable successes in the clinic, cancer targeted therapy development remains challenging and the failure rate is disappointingly high. This problem is partly due to the misapplication of the targeted therapy paradigm to therapeutics targeting pan-essential genes, which can result in therapeutics whereby efficacy is attenuated by dose-limiting toxicity. Here we summarize the key features of successful chemotherapy and targeted therapy agents, and use case studies to outline recurrent challenges to drug development efforts targeting pan-essential genes. Finally, we suggest strategies to avoid previous pitfalls for ongoing and future development of pan-essential therapeutics.},

  abstract = {Primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphomas (PMBLs) are aggressive tumors that typically present as large mediastinal masses in young women. PMBLs share clinical, transcriptional, and molecular features with classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL), including constitutive activation of nuclear factor κB (NF-κB), JAK/STAT signaling, and programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1)-mediated immune evasion. The demonstrated efficacy of PD-1 blockade in relapsed/refractory PMBLs led to recent approval by the US Food and Drug Administration and underscored the importance of characterizing targetable genetic vulnerabilities in this disease. Here, we report a comprehensive analysis of recurrent genetic alterations -somatic mutations, somatic copy number alterations, and structural variants-in a cohort of 37 newly diagnosed PMBLs. We identified a median of 9 genetic drivers per PMBL, including known and newly identified components of the JAK/STAT and NF-κB signaling pathways and frequent B2M alterations that limit major histocompatibility complex class I expression, as in cHL. PMBL also exhibited frequent, newly identified driver mutations in ZNF217 and an additional epigenetic modifier, EZH2. The majority of these alterations were clonal, which supports their role as early drivers. In PMBL, we identified several previously uncharacterized molecular features that may increase sensitivity to PD-1 blockade, including high tumor mutational burden, microsatellite instability, and an apolipoprotein B mRNA editing catalytic polypeptide-like (APOBEC) mutational signature. The shared genetic features between PMBL and cHL provide a framework for analyzing the mechanism of action of PD-1 blockade in these related lymphoid malignancies.},

We carried out a comprehensive genetic analysis of 304 primary DLBCLs and identified low-frequency alterations, captured recurrent mutations, somatic copy number alterations, and structural variants, and defined coordinate signatures in patients with available outcome data. We integrated these genetic drivers using consensus clustering and identified five robust DLBCL subsets, including a previously unrecognized group of low-risk ABC-DLBCLs of extrafollicular/marginal zone origin; two distinct subsets of GCB-DLBCLs with different outcomes and targetable alterations; and an ABC/GCB-independent group with biallelic inactivation of TP53, CDKN2A loss, and associated genomic instability. The genetic features of the newly characterized subsets, their mutational signatures, and the temporal ordering of identified alterations provide new insights into DLBCL pathogenesis. The coordinate genetic signatures also predict outcome independent of the clinical International Prognostic Index and suggest new combination treatment strategies. More broadly, our results provide a roadmap for an actionable DLBCL classification.},

The complexity and diversity associated with the hnRNPs render them multifunctional, involved not only in processing heterogeneous nuclear RNAs (hnRNAs) into mature mRNAs, but also acting as trans-factors in regulating gene expression. Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein E1 (hnRNP E1), a subgroup of hnRNPs, is a KH-triple repeat containing RNA-binding protein. It is encoded by an intronless gene arising from hnRNP E2 through a retrotransposition event. hnRNP E1 is ubiquitously expressed and functions in regulating major steps of gene expression, including pre-mRNA processing, mRNA stability, and translation. Given its wide-ranging functions in the nucleus and cytoplasm and interaction with multiple proteins, we propose a post-transcriptional regulon model that explains hnRNP E1's widespread functional diversity.},

Despite extensive transcriptomic profiling, the identification of TGF-beta-inducible, EMT-specific genes has met with limited success. Here we identify a post-transcriptional pathway by which TGF-beta modulates the expression of EMT-specific proteins and of EMT itself. We show that heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein E1 (hnRNP E1) binds a structural, 33-nucleotide TGF-beta-activated translation (BAT) element in the 3' untranslated region of disabled-2 (Dab2) and interleukin-like EMT inducer (ILEI) transcripts, and represses their translation. TGF-beta activation leads to phosphorylation at Ser 43 of hnRNP E1 by protein kinase Bbeta/Akt2, inducing its release from the BAT element and translational activation of Dab2 and ILEI messenger RNAs. Modulation of hnRNP E1 expression or its post-translational modification alters the TGF-beta-mediated reversal of translational silencing of the target transcripts and EMT. These results suggest the existence of a TGF-beta-inducible post-transcriptional regulon that controls EMT during the development and metastatic progression of tumours.},

Long-read assemblers using a variety of assembly algorithms have been developed to overcome this deficiency, which have not been benchmarked for genomic analyses of bacterial pathogens using Oxford Nanopore long reads. In this study, long-read assemblers, namely Canu, Flye, Miniasm/Racon, Raven, Redbean, and Shasta, were thus benchmarked using Oxford Nanopore long reads of bacterial pathogens. Ten species were tested for mediocre- and low-quality simulated reads, and 10 species were tested for real reads. Raven was the most robust assembler, obtaining complete and accurate genomes. All Miniasm/Racon and Raven assemblies of mediocre-quality reads provided accurate antimicrobial resistance (AMR) profiles, while the Raven assembly of Klebsiella variicola with low-quality reads was the only assembly with an accurate AMR profile among all assemblers and species. All assemblers functioned well for predicting virulence genes using mediocre-quality and real reads, whereas only the Raven assemblies of low-quality reads had accurate numbers of virulence genes. Regarding multilocus sequence typing (MLST), Miniasm/Racon was the most effective assembler for mediocre-quality reads, while only the Raven assemblies of Escherichia coli O157:H7 and K. variicola with low-quality reads showed positive MLST results. Miniasm/Racon and Raven were the best performers for MLST using real reads. The Miniasm/Racon and Raven assemblies showed accurate phylogenetic inference. For the pan-genome analyses, Raven was the strongest assembler for simulated reads, whereas Miniasm/Racon and Raven performed the best for real reads. Overall, the most robust and accurate assembler was Raven, closely followed by Miniasm/Racon.},

Exon 6 is included in mRNA encoding nonmuscle TM-1, whereas exon 7 is used in mRNA encoding skeletal muscle β-TM. Previously, we demonstrated that a six nucleotide mutation at the 5′ end of exon 7, designated as ex-1, activated exon 7 splicing in nonmuscle cells. In this study, we show that the activating effect of this mutation is not the result of creating an exonic splicing enhancer (ESE) or disrupting a putative secondary structure. The sequence in exon 7 acts as a bona fide exonic splicing silencer (ESS), which is bound specifically by atrans-acting factor. Isolation and peptide sequencing reveal that this factor is hnRNP H, a member of the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) family. Binding of hnRNP H correlates with the ESS activity. Furthermore, addition of antibodies that specifically recognizes hnRNP H to the splicing reactions or partial depletion of hnRNP H from nuclear extract activates exon 7 splicing in vitro and this effect can be reversed by addition of purified recombinant hnRNP H. These results indicate that hnRNP H participates in exclusion of exon 7 in nonmuscle cells. The involvement of hnRNP H in the activity of an ESS may represent a prototype for the regulation of tissue- and developmental-specific alternative splicing.},

Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and Southern blot analysis of tumor cells identified the translocation breakpoint within the 5′ switch region of IGHG (Sγ). We cloned the chimeric breakpoint region approximately 1.5 kbp downstream from the HindIII site of 5′Sγ2 on chromosome 14q32 and identified a 360-bp novel segment with homology to the CpG island clone 11h8. Two BAC clones containing this sequence were isolated and mapped to 1q21 by FISH. BAC 342/P13 contained sequences homologous to Fcγ receptors 2A, 3A, 2B, 3B, and a heat shock protein gene HSP70B. The translocation brought the Sγ2 region of a productive IGH allele 20∼30 kbp upstream of FCGR2B. As a result of the translocation, the b2 isoform of FCGR2B was overexpressed in the tumor. Screening of a panel of 76 B-cell lymphomas with 1q21-23 cytogenetic aberrations by Southern blot analysis using breakpoint probes identified an additional FL with a t(14;18)(q32;q21) and a breakpoint in the FCGR2B region. These results suggest that FCGR2B may be deregulated by 1q21 aberration in BCL2 rearranged FLs and possibly play a role in their progression.}

Manta can discover and score variants based on supporting paired and split-read evidence, with scoring models optimized for germline analysis of diploid individuals and somatic analysis of tumor-normal sample pairs. Call quality is similar to or better than comparable methods, as determined by pedigree consistency of germline calls and comparison of somatic calls to COSMIC database variants. Manta consistently assembles a higher fraction of its calls to base-pair resolution, allowing for improved downstream annotation and analysis of clinical significance.

We herein show that TP is highly induced by serum deprivation in NPC cells, and that this is due to an increase in the half-life of the TP mRNA, as shown by nuclear run-on and actinomycin D assays. We further show that the CU-rich element of the TP mRNA directly interacts with hnRNP K, as demonstrated by immunoprecipitation RT–PCR assays, and the nucleus-to-cytoplasm translocation of hnRNP K. Blockade of hnRNP K expression reduces TP expression, suggesting that hnRNP K acts in the upregulation of TP. Mechanistically, both MEK inhibitor and the hnRNP K ERK-phosphoacceptor-site mutant decrease cytoplasmic accumulation of hnRNP K, suggesting that ERK-dependent phosphorylation is critical for TP induction. Furthermore, we found that hnRNP K-mediated TP induction allows NPC cells to resist hypoxia-induced apoptosis. Our results collectively establish the regulation and role of ERK-mediated cytoplasmic accumulation of hnRNP K as an upstream modulator of TP, suggesting that hnRNP K may be an attractive candidate as a future therapeutic target for cancer.},

CLL primarily affects the elderly and may be associated with multiple comorbidities. A cure has not been identified, and new treatment options are needed. Expression of Bcl-2 protein is associated with the pathogenesis of CLL and chemotherapy resistance. Oblimersen, a Bcl-2 antisense phosphorothioate oligonucleotide, is being evaluated in patients with CLL and other cancers; trials through Phase III have been completed. In the setting of relapsed/refractory CLL, single-agent oblimersen demonstrates modest activity, whereas the addition of oblimersen to fludarabine/cyclophosphamide significantly improves the rate of complete and nodular partial responses; moreover, these responses are durable and associated with clinical benefit. Oblimersen is more efficacious in relapsed rather than refractory patients. The side effect profile of oblimersen, alone or in combination with standard chemotherapy, is favorable compared with currently available chemotherapies. In the first cycle, an infusion reaction with or without tumor lysis syndrome is uncommon, and transient thrombocytopenia is observed. Catheter-related complications are associated with the need for continuous intravenous infusion of oblimersen over several days; other routes of administration are under clinical investigation. Oblimersen is a promising therapeutic approach for patients with relapsed CLL and should be further evaluated in the front-line setting.},

  abstract = {Clinical correlative studies have linked 1p36 deletions with worse prognosis in follicular lymphoma (FL). In this study, we sought to identify the critical gene(s) in this region that is responsible for conferring inferior prognosis. BAC array technology applied to 141 FL specimens detected a minimum region of deletion (MRD) of ∼97 kb within 1p36.32 in 20\% of these cases. Frequent single-nucleotide polymorphism-detected copy-neutral loss of heterozygosity was also found in this region. Analysis of promoter CpGs in the MRD did not reveal differential patterns of DNA methylation in samples that differed in 1p36 status. Exon sequencing of MRD genes identified somatic alterations in the TNFRSF14 gene in 3 of 11 selected cases with matching normal DNA. An expanded cohort consisting of 251 specimens identified 46 cases (18.3\%) with nonsynonymous mutations affecting TNFRSF14. Overall survival (OS) and disease-specific survival (DSS) were associated with the presence of TNFRSF14 mutation in patients whose overall treatment included rituximab. We further showed that inferior OS and DSS were most pronounced in patients whose lymphomas contained both TNFRSF14 mutations and 1p36 deletions after adjustment for the International Prognostic Index [hazard ratios of 3.65 (95\% confidence interval, 1.35-9.878, P=0.011) and 3.19 (95\% confidence interval, 1.06-9.57, P=0.039), respectively]. Our findings identify TNFRSF14 as a candidate gene associated with a subset of FL, based on frequent occurrence of acquired mutations and their correlation with inferior clinical outcomes.},

Although PDL copy-number variations are well characterized, a detailed and comprehensive analysis of structural rearrangements (SRs) and associated phenotypic consequences is largely lacking. Here, we used oligonucleotide capture sequencing of 67 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues derived from primary B-cell lymphomas and 1 cell line to detect and characterize, at base-pair resolution, SRs of the PDL locus (9p24.1; harboring PDL1/CD274 and PDL2/PDCD1LG2). We describe 36 novel PDL SRs, including 17 intrachromosomal events (inversions, duplications, deletions) and 19 translocations involving BZRAP-AS1, CD44, GET4, IL4R, KIAA0226L, MID1, RCC1, PTPN1 and segments of the immunoglobulin loci. Moreover, analysis of the precise chromosomal breakpoints reveals 2 distinct cluster breakpoint regions (CBRs) within either CD274 (CBR1) or PDCD1LG2 (CBR2). To determine the phenotypic consequences of these SRs, we performed immunohistochemistry for CD274 and PDCD1LG2 on primary pretreatment biopsies and found that PDL SRs are significantly associated with PDL protein expression. Finally, stable ectopic expression of wild-type PDCD1LG2 and the PDCD1LG2-IGHV7-81 fusion showed, in coculture, significantly reduced T-cell activation. Taken together, our data demonstrate the complementary utility of fluorescence in situ hybridization and capture sequencing approaches and provide a classification scheme for PDL SRs with implications for future studies using PDL immune-checkpoint inhibitors in B-cell lymphomas.},

Previous studies exploring MYC rearrangements have primarily used fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) assays to characterize break-apart status but have rarely examined breakpoint location, and in some cases have not examined partner identity. We performed targeted sequencing of MYC, BCL2, BCL6, and the immunoglobulin (IG) loci in 112 tumors with DLBCL morphology harboring MYC rearrangement. We characterized the location of the MYC rearrangement at base pair resolution and identified the partner in 88 cases. We observed a cluster of breakpoints upstream of the MYC coding region and in intron 1 (the "genic cluster"). Genic cluster rearrangements were enriched for translocations involving IGH (80\%), whereas nongenic rearrangements occurred mostly downstream of the MYC gene with a variety of partners, including IGL and IGK Other recurrent partners included BCL6, ZCCHC7, and RFTN1, which has not previously been described as a MYC partner. We compared 2 commercially available FISH break-apart assays for the MYC locus and observed discordant results in 32\% of cases examined, including some with MYC-IGL and MYC-IGK rearrangements. In cases of high-grade B-cell lymphoma with MYC and BCL2 and/or BCL6 rearrangement (HGBL-DH), so-called "double-hit" lymphomas, the majority of MYC rearrangements had non-IG partners (65\%), with breakpoints outside the genic cluster (72\%). In patients with de novo HGBL-DH of DLBCL morphology, MYC-IG rearrangements showed a trend toward inferior time to progression and overall survival compared with MYC-non-IG rearrangements. Our data reveal clinically relevant architecture of MYC rearrangements in lymphomas with DLBCL morphology.},

While p63 expression is controlled mostly by post-translational modifications, recent studies indicate that transcriptional and posttranscriptional regulations are essential for proper p63 expression. Here, we investigated the regulation of p63 expression by poly (C)-binding protein 1 (PCBP1, also known as hnRNP-E1 and αCP1). We found that knockdown of PCBP1 decreases the level of p63 transcript and protein. We also found that PCBP1 regulates the stability of p63 mRNA via binding to p63 3’UTR. Additionally, we found that a CU-rich element (CUE) in p63 3′UTR is bound by and responsive to PCBP1. Together, we conclude that PCBP1 regulates p63 expression via mRNA stability.},

PVT1 encodes an oncogenic lncRNA, but recurrent translocations and deletions in human cancers suggest alternative mechanisms. Here, we show that the PVT1 promoter has a tumor-suppressor function that is independent of PVT1 lncRNA. CRISPR interference of PVT1 promoter enhances breast cancer cell competition and growth in~vivo. The promoters of the PVT1 and the MYC oncogenes, located 55 kb apart on chromosome 8q24, compete for engagement with four intragenic enhancers in the PVT1 locus, thereby allowing the PVT1 promoter to regulate pause release of MYC transcription. PVT1 undergoes developmentally regulated monoallelic expression, and the PVT1 promoter inhibits MYC expression only from the same chromosome via promoter competition. Cancer genome sequencing identifies recurrent mutations encompassing the human PVT1 promoter, and genome editing verified that PVT1 promoter mutation promotes cancer cell growth. These results highlight regulatory sequences of lncRNA genes as potential disease-associated DNA elements.},

  abstract = {Alternative splicing of pre-messenger RNA (mRNA) is a critical stage of gene regulation in response to environmental stimuli. Here we show that DAZAP1, an RNA-binding protein involved in mammalian development and spermatogenesis, promotes inclusion of weak exons through specific recognition of diverse cis-elements. The carboxy-terminal proline-rich domain of DAZAP1 interacts with and neutralizes general splicing inhibitors, and is sufficient to activate splicing when recruited to pre-mRNA. This domain is phosphorylated by the MEK/Erk (extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase) pathway and this modification is essential for the splicing regulatory activity and the nuclear/cytoplasmic translocation of DAZAP1. Using mRNA-seq, we identify endogenous splicing events regulated by DAZAP1, many of which are involved in maintaining cell growth. Knockdown or over-expression of DAZAP1 causes a cell proliferation defect. Taken together, these studies reveal a molecular mechanism that integrates splicing control into MEK/Erk-regulated cell proliferation.},

  abstract = {The regulation of the c-src N1 exon is mediated by an intronic splicing enhancer downstream of the N1 5' splice site. Previous experiments showed that a set of proteins assembles onto the most conserved core of this enhancer sequence specifically in neuronal WERI-1 cell extracts. The most prominent components of this enhancer complex are the proteins hnRNP F, KSRP, and an unidentified protein of 58 kDa (p58). This p58 protein was purified from the WERI-1 cell nuclear extract by ammonium sulfate precipitation, Mono Q chromatography, and immunoprecipitation with anti-Sm antibody Y12. Peptide sequence analysis of purified p58 protein identified it as hnRNP H. Immunoprecipitation of hnRNP H cross-linked to the N1 enhancer RNA, as well as gel mobility shift analysis of the enhancer complex in the presence of hnRNP H-specific antibodies, confirmed that hnRNP H is a protein component of the splicing enhancer complex. Immunoprecipitation of splicing intermediates from in vitro splicing reactions with anti-hnRNP H antibody indicated that hnRNP H remains bound to the src pre-mRNA after the assembly of spliceosome. Partial immunodepletion of hnRNP H from the nuclear extract partially inactivated the splicing of the N1 exon in vitro. This inhibition of splicing can be restored by the addition of recombinant hnRNP H, indicating that hnRNP H is an important factor for N1 splicing. Finally, in vitro binding assays demonstrate that hnRNP H can interact with the related protein hnRNP F, suggesting that hnRNPs H and F may exist as a heterodimer in a single enhancer complex. These two proteins presumably cooperate with each other and with other enhancer complex proteins to direct splicing to the N1 exon upstream.},

  abstract = {Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), the most common form of lymphoma in adulthood, comprises multiple biologically and clinically distinct subtypes including germinal centre B-cell-like (GCB) and activated B-cell-like (ABC) DLBCL. Gene expression profile studies have shown that its most aggressive subtype, ABC-DLBCL, is associated with constitutive activation of the NF-kappaB transcription complex. However, except for a small fraction of cases, it remains unclear whether NF-kappaB activation in these tumours represents an intrinsic program of the tumour cell of origin or a pathogenetic event. Here we show that {$>$}50\% of ABC-DLBCL and a smaller fraction of GCB-DLBCL carry somatic mutations in multiple genes, including negative (TNFAIP3, also called A20) and positive (CARD11, TRAF2, TRAF5, MAP3K7 (TAK1) and TNFRSF11A (RANK)) regulators of NF-kappaB. Of these, the A20 gene, which encodes a ubiquitin-modifying enzyme involved in termination of NF-kappaB responses, is most commonly affected, with approximately 30\% of patients displaying biallelic inactivation by mutations and/or deletions. When reintroduced in cell lines carrying biallelic inactivation of the gene, A20 induced apoptosis and cell growth arrest, indicating a tumour suppressor role. Less frequently, missense mutations of TRAF2 and CARD11 produce molecules with significantly enhanced ability to activate NF-kappaB. Thus, our results demonstrate that NF-kappaB activation in DLBCL is caused by genetic lesions affecting multiple genes, the loss or activation of which may promote lymphomagenesis by leading to abnormally prolonged NF-kappaB responses.},

  abstract = {Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) with MYC rearrangement (MYC-R) carries an unfavorable outcome. We explored the prognostic value of the MYC translocation partner gene in a series of MYC-R de novo DLBCL patients enrolled in first-line prospective clinical trials (Groupe d’Etudes des Lymphomes de l’Adulte/Lymphoma Study Association) and treated with rituximab-anthracycline–based chemotherapy. A total of 774 DLBCL cases characterized for cell of origin by the Hans classifier were analyzed using fluorescence in situ hybridization with BCL2, BCL6, MYC, immunoglobulin (IG)K, and IGL break-apart and IGH/MYC, IGK/MYC, and IGL/MYC fusion probes. MYC-R was observed in 51/574 (8.9\%) evaluable DLBCL cases. MYC-R cases were predominantly of the germinal center B-cell–like subtype 37/51 (74\%) with no distinctive morphologic and phenotypic features. Nineteen cases were MYC single-hit and 32 cases were MYC double-hit (MYC plus BCL2 and/or BCL6) DLBCL. MYC translocation partner was an IG gene in 24 cases (MYC-IG) and a non-IG gene (MYC-non-IG) in 26 of 50 evaluable cases. Noteworthy, MYC-IG patients had shorter overall survival (OS) (P = .0002) compared with MYC-negative patients, whereas no survival difference was observed between MYC-non-IG and MYC-negative patients. In multivariate analyses, MYC-IG predicted poor progression-free survival (P = .0051) and OS (P = .0006) independently from the International Prognostic Index and the Hans classifier. In conclusion, we show in this prospective randomized trial that the adverse prognostic impact of MYC-R is correlated to the MYC-IG translocation partner gene in DLBCL patients treated with immunochemotherapy. These results may have an important impact on the clinical management of DLBCL patients with MYC-R who should be routinely characterized according to MYC partner gene. These trials are individually registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as \#NCT00144807, \#NCT01087424, \#NCT00169143, \#NCT00144755, \#NCT00140660, \#NCT00140595, and \#NCT00135499.},

  abstract = {Primary lymphomas of the CNS (PCNSLs) show molecular features of the late germinal center exit B-cell phenotype and are impaired in their terminal differentiation as indicated by a lack of immunoglobulin class switching. Because the positive regulatory domain I protein with ZNF domain (PRDM1/BLIMP1) is a master regulator of terminal B-cell differentiation into plasma cells, we investigated a series of 21 PCNSLs for the presence of mutations in the PRDM1 gene and alterations in the expression pattern of the PRDM1 protein. Direct sequencing of all coding exons of the PRDM1 gene identified deleterious mutations associated with abrogation of PRDM1 protein expression in 4 of 21 (19\%) PCNSLs. Thus, similar to systemic diffuse large B-cell lymphomas, PRDM1 may be a tumor suppressor in some PCNSL and contribute to lymphomagenesis by impairing terminal differentiation.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: For patients with relapsed or refractory aggressive lymphoma, we hypothesized that gemcitabine-based therapy before autologous stem-cell transplantation (ASCT) is as effective as and less toxic than standard treatment. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We randomly assigned 619 patients with relapsed/refractory aggressive lymphoma to treatment with gemcitabine, dexamethasone, and cisplatin (GDP) or to dexamethasone, cytarabine, and cisplatin (DHAP). Patients with B-cell lymphoma also received rituximab. Responding patients proceeded to stem-cell collection and ASCT. Coprimary end points were response rate after two treatment cycles and transplantation rate. The noninferiority margin for the response rate to GDP relative to DHAP was set at 10\%. Secondary end points included event-free and overall survival, treatment toxicity, and quality of life. RESULTS: For the intention-to-treat population, the response rate with GDP was 45.2\%; with DHAP the response rate was 44.0\% (95\% CI for difference, -9.0\% to 6.7\%), meeting protocol-defined criteria for noninferiority of GDP (P = .005). Similar results were obtained in a per-protocol analysis. The transplantation rates were 52.1\% with GDP and 49.3\% with DHAP (P = .44). At a median follow-up of 53 months, no differences were detected in event-free survival (HR, 0.99; stratified log-rank P = .95) or overall survival (HR, 1.03; P = .78) between GDP and DHAP. Treatment with GDP was associated with less toxicity (P {$<$} .001) and need for hospitalization (P {$<$} .001), and preserved quality of life (P = .04). CONCLUSION: For patients with relapsed or refractory aggressive lymphoma, in comparison with DHAP, treatment with GDP is associated with a noninferior response rate, similar transplantation rate, event-free survival, and overall survival, less toxicity and hospitalization, and superior quality of life.},

  abstract = {Background DAZAP1 (DAZ Associated Protein 1) was originally identified by a yeast two-hybrid system through its interaction with a putative male infertility factor, DAZ (Deleted in Azoospermia). In vitro, DAZAP1 interacts with both the Y chromosome-encoded DAZ and an autosome-encoded DAZ-like protein, DAZL. DAZAP1 contains two RNA-binding domains (RBDs) and a proline-rich C-terminal portion, and is expressed most abundantly in the testis. To understand the biological function of DAZAP1 and the significance of its interaction with DAZ and DAZL, we isolated and characterized the mouse Dazap1 gene, and studied its expression and the subcellular localization of its protein product. Results The human and mouse genes have similar genomic structures and map to syntenic chromosomal regions. The mouse and human DAZAP1 proteins share 98\% identity and their sequences are highly similar to the Xenopus orthologue Prrp, especially in the RBDs. Dazap1 is expressed throughout testis development. Western blot detects a single 45 kD DAZAP1 protein that is most abundant in the testis. Although a majority of DAZAP1 is present in the cytoplasmic fraction, they are not associated with polyribosomes. Conclusions DAZAP1 is evolutionarily highly conserved. Its predominant expression in testes suggests a role in spermatogenesis. Its subcellular localization indicates that it is not directly involved in mRNA translation.},

  abstract = {Primary mediastinal B-Cell lymphoma (PMBL) is a recently defined entity comprising \textasciitilde 2-10\% non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHL). Unlike most NHL subtypes, PMBL lacks recurrent gene rearrangements to serve as biomarkers or betray target genes. While druggable, late chemotherapeutic complications warrant the search for new targets and models. Well characterized tumor cell lines provide unlimited material to serve as preclinical resources for verifiable analyses directed at the discovery of new biomarkers and pathological targets using high throughput microarray technologies. The same cells may then be used to seek intelligent therapies directed at clinically validated targets. Four cell lines have emerged as potential PMBL models: FARAGE, KARPAS-1106P, MEDB-1 and U-2940. Transcriptionally, PMBL cell lines cluster near c(lassical)-HL and B-NHL examples showing they are related but separate entities. Here we document genomic alterations therein, by cytogenetics and high density oligonucleotide/SNP microarrays and parse their impact by integrated global expression profiling. PMBL cell lines were distinguished by moderate chromosome rearrangement levels undercutting cHL, while lacking oncogene translocations seen in B-NHL. In total 61 deletions were shared by two or more cell lines, together with 12 amplifications (≥4x) and 72 homozygous regions. Integrated genomic and transcriptional profiling showed deletions to be the most important class of chromosome rearrangement. Lesions were mapped to several loci associated with PMBL, e.g. 2p15 (REL/COMMD1), 9p24 (JAK2, CD274), 16p13 (SOCS1, LITAF, CIITA); plus new or tenuously associated loci: 2p16 (MSH6), 6q23 (TNFAIP3), 9p22 (CDKN2A/B), 20p12 (PTPN1). Discrete homozygous regions sometimes substituted focal deletions accompanied by gene silencing implying a role for epigenetic or mutational inactivation. Genomic amplifications increasing gene expression or gene-activating rearrangements were respectively rare or absent. Our findings highlight biallelic deletions as a major class of chromosomal lesion in PMBL cell lines, while endorsing the latter as preclinical models for hunting and testing new biomarkers and actionable targets.},

  abstract = {TO THE EDITOR:Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is a heterogeneous disease identified by morphology, immunophenotype, and a typically aggressive clinical course.1 DLBCL has long been stratified based on gene expression profiling (GEP) into activated B-cell–like (ABC) and germinal center B-cell–like (GCB) cell-of-origin (COO) subtypes.2 Recently, several studies stratified DLBCL into genetic subgroups based on the co-occurrence of mutational features with strong associations with COO.3-6 Previously, our 2 groups independently reported gene expression signatures associated with dark-zone–like biology in DLBCL. The molecular high-grade signature (MHG) identifies DLBCLs expressing a Burkitt lymphoma (BL)-like GEP signature,7 whereas the double-hit signature (since renamed dark-zone signature [DZsig]8) identifies DLBCLs with a GEP signature like high-grade B-cell lymphoma with MYC and BCL2 rearrangement (HGBCL-DH-BCL2) (whether the tumors harbor MYC and BCL2 rearrangements or not).9,10 Remarkably, despite the small overlap in the genes that comprise each signature, both classifiers identified a subset of DLBCL tumors enriched for certain genetic aberrations, including concomitant MYC and BCL2 rearrangements.7,9}

Genes involved in JAK/STAT, NFkB and PI3K signaling and antigen presentation were most frequently affected. SOCS1 variants, mainly deletions, were found in most circulating tumor (ct) DNAs, and seven of the nine translocation breakpoints involved SOCS1. Analysis of VH-DH-JH rearrangements revealed an origin of PHL HRS cells from partially selected germinal center B cells. Amounts of pretherapy ctDNA were correlated with metabolic tumor volumes. Furthermore, in all ccfDNA samples of 43 patients with early response assessment quantitative qPET\,{$<$}\,3, indicative of a favorable clinical course, ctDNA was not detectable. In contrast, in five of six patients with qPET\,{$>$}\,3, indicative of an unfavorable clinical course, ctDNA remained detectable. ccfDNA analysis of PHL is thus a suitable approach to determine pathogenic mechanisms and monitor therapy response.},

  abstract = {The germinal centre (GC) of lymphoid organs is the microenvironment in which antigen-activated B cells diversify their immunoglobulin genes by somatic hypermutation (SHM) to generate high-affinity antibodies. A subset of the cells also undergoes class-switch recombination to generate antibodies with specialized effector functions.Early in an immune response, antigen-stimulated B cells form long-lived interactions with antigen-specific T cells at the border between the B cell zone and the T cell zone or the interfollicular region to become fully activated. Antigen-activated B cells and T cells are committed to differentiate into GC B cells and T follicular helper cells (TFH cells), respectively, outside of the follicle. Migration into the follicle is facilitated by B cell lymphoma 6 (BCL-6), which is the master transcriptional regulator of GC B cells.One day after TFH cells have moved into the follicle, GC precursor B cells migrate from the border between the B cell zone and the T cell zone or the interfollicular region into the centre of the follicle to form an early GC. The B cells differentiate into blasts and, over the next several days, rapidly divide and begin to fill the centre of the follicle until they have formed a mature GC that is polarized into two microenvironments known as the dark and light zones.Dark zone B cells, which are GC B cells that undergo active SHM, are programmed to proliferate extremely rapidly and thereby to generate a large number of immunoglobulin mutations in a short time. Dark zone B cells differentiate into light zone B cells, at which stage mutants expressing high-affinity antibodies are selected and instructed to either recirculate to the dark zone to undergo further rounds of SHM or to differentiate into memory B cells or plasma cells.Light zone B cells capture antigen via the B cell receptor (BCR) and present the processed antigen on MHC complexes to TFH cells. Higher BCR affinity is directly associated with greater antigen capture and leads to a higher density of peptide–MHC complex presentation on the surface of the B cell. This results in the greatest share of T cell help, which in turn drives selection.Evidence suggests that the transcription factors MYC and the nuclear factor-κB subunit REL are essential for the maintenance of the GC reaction as they 'license' antigen-selected light zone B cells to recirculate to the dark zone. Inhibition of the terminal differentiation of GC B cells is controlled by multiple mechanisms that include both transcriptional and non-transcriptional regulation.},

  abstract = {Post-transcriptional mRNA regulation by RNA binding proteins (RBPs) associated with AU-rich elements (AREs) present in the 3′ untranslated region (3’UTR) of specific mRNAs modulates transcript stability and translation in eukaryotic cells. Here we have functionally characterised the importance of the AREs present within the Bcl2 3’UTR in order to maintain Bcl2 expression. Gene targeting deletion of 300 nucleotides of the Bcl2 3’UTR rich in AREs diminishes Bcl2 mRNA stability and protein levels in primary B cells, decreasing cell lifespan. Generation of chimeric mice indicates that Bcl2-ARE∆/∆ B cells have an intrinsic competitive disadvantage compared to wild type cells. Biochemical assays and predictions using a bioinformatics approach show that several RBPs bind to the Bcl2 AREs, including AUF1 and HuR proteins. Altogether, association of RBPs to Bcl2 AREs contributes to Bcl2 protein expression by stabilizing Bcl2 mRNA and promotes B cell maintenance.},

Transcriptional control is the first step to build efficient responses while preventing immunodeficiencies and autoimmunity. Post-transcriptional regulation of RNA editing, location, stability and translation are the other key steps for final gene expression and they are all controlled by RNA binding proteins. Nowadays we have a deep understanding of how transcription factors control the immune system but recent evidences suggest that post-transcriptional regulation by RNA binding proteins is equally important for both development and activation of immune responses. Here we review current knowledge about how post-transcriptional control by RNA binding proteins shapes our immune system and we discuss the perspective of RNA binding proteins being the key players of a hidden immune cell epitranscriptome.},

  abstract = {Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) poses a threat to public health. Clinical microbiology laboratories typically rely on culturing bacteria for antimicrobial-susceptibility testing (AST). As the implementation costs and technical barriers fall, whole-genome sequencing (WGS) has emerged as a 'one-stop' test for epidemiological and predictive AST results. Few published comparisons exist for the myriad analytical pipelines used for predicting AMR. To address this, we performed an inter-laboratory study providing sets of participating researchers with identical short-read WGS data from clinical isolates, allowing us to assess the reproducibility of the bioinformatic prediction of AMR between participants, and identify problem cases and factors that lead to discordant results. We produced ten WGS datasets of varying quality from cultured carbapenem-resistant organisms obtained from clinical samples sequenced on either an Illumina NextSeq or HiSeq instrument. Nine participating teams ('participants') were provided these sequence data without any other contextual information. Each participant used their choice of pipeline to determine the species, the presence of resistance-associated genes, and to predict susceptibility or resistance to amikacin, gentamicin, ciprofloxacin and cefotaxime. We found participants predicted different numbers of AMR-associated genes and different gene variants from the same clinical samples. The quality of the sequence data, choice of bioinformatic pipeline and interpretation of the results all contributed to discordance between participants. Although much of the inaccurate gene variant annotation did not affect genotypic resistance predictions, we observed low specificity when compared to phenotypic AST results, but this improved in samples with higher read depths. Had the results been used to predict AST and guide treatment, a different antibiotic would have been recommended for each isolate by at least one participant. These challenges, at the final analytical stage of using WGS to predict AMR, suggest the need for refinements when using this technology in clinical settings. Comprehensive public resistance sequence databases, full recommendations on sequence data quality and standardization in the comparisons between genotype and resistance phenotypes will all play a fundamental role in the successful implementation of AST prediction using WGS in clinical microbiology laboratories.},

Increases in cytological grade are a feature of the clinical progression of this malignancy, and eventual histologic transformation (HT) to the aggressive diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) occurs in up to 15\% of patients. Clinical or genetic features to predict the risk and timing of HT have not been described comprehensively. In this study, we analyzed whole-genome sequencing data from 423 patients to compare the protein coding and noncoding mutation landscapes of untransformed FL, transformed FL, and de novo DLBCL. This revealed 2 genetically distinct subgroups of FL, which we have named DLBCL-like (dFL) and constrained FL (cFL). Each subgroup has distinguishing mutational patterns, aberrant somatic hypermutation rates, and biological and clinical characteristics. We implemented a machine learning-derived classification approach to stratify patients with FL into cFL and dFL subgroups based on their genomic features. Using separate validation cohorts, we demonstrate that cFL status, whether assigned with this full classifier or a single-gene approximation, is associated with a reduced rate of HT. This implies distinct biological features of cFL that constrain its evolution, and we highlight the potential for this classification to predict HT from genetic features present at diagnosis.},

Seeking to explain the discrepancies, we reanalyzed their data using established open-source pipelines. This revealed thousands of mutations that could not be independently reproduced by these pipelines and a larger set of high-quality mutations that were not reported by Reddy. This caused an artificial under-representation of the mutation prevalence in many genes including clinically relevant hot spots affecting EZH2 and CD79B. More generally, the study had an under-representation of mutations in DLBCL genes that disproportionately affected genes known to have the highest mutation rates. The missing variants and the spurious variants can be attributed to distinct problems with the analytical approaches employed in that study. Our analysis also identified strong associations between mutations and patient outcome including TP53, KMT2D and PIM1, which were not found in the Reddy study. Overall, we demonstrate that this combination of errors influenced many of the central novel findings from their study rendering their results largely non-replicable. The full results of our analyses are included as supplemental items as a resource for other researchers with an interest in the genetics of B-cell lymphomas.},

Lymphomas with gene expression features of PMBL have been described in nonmediastinal sites, raising questions about how these tumors should be classified. Here, we investigated whether these nonmediastinal lymphomas are indeed PMBLs or instead represent a distinct group within diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). From a cohort of 325 de novo DLBCL cases, we identified tumors from patients without evidence of anterior mediastinal involvement that expressed a PMBL expression signature (nm-PMBLsig+; n = 16; 5\%). A majority of these tumors expressed MAL and CD23, proteins typically observed in bona fide PMBL (bf-PMBL). Evaluation of clinical features of nm-PMBLsig+ cases revealed close associations with DLBCL, and a majority displayed a germinal center B cell-like cell of origin (GCB). In contrast to patients with bf-PMBL, patients with nm-PMBLsig+ presented at an older age and did not show pleural disease, and bone/bone marrow involvement was observed in 3 cases. However, although clinically distinct from bf-PMBL, nm-PMBLsig+ tumors resembled bf-PMBL at the molecular level, with upregulation of immune response, JAK-STAT, and NF-κB signatures. Mutational analysis revealed frequent somatic gene mutations in SOCS1, IL4R, ITPKB, and STAT6, as well as CD83 and BIRC3, with the latter genes significantly more frequently affected than in GCB DLBCL or bf-PMBL. Our data establish nm-PMBLsig+ lymphomas as a group within DLBCL with distinct phenotypic and genetic features. These findings may have implications for gene expression- and mutation-based subtyping of aggressive B-cell lymphomas and related targeted therapies.},

  abstract = {Lymphoma is the most common hematological malignancy in developed countries. Outcome is strongly determined by molecular subtype, reflecting a need for new and improved treatment options. Dogs spontaneously develop lymphoma, and the predisposition of certain breeds indicates genetic risk factors. Using the dog breed structure, we selected three lymphoma predisposed breeds developing primarily T-cell (boxer), primarily B-cell (cocker spaniel), and with equal distribution of B- and T-cell lymphoma (golden retriever), respectively. We investigated the somatic mutations in B- and T-cell lymphomas from these breeds by exome sequencing of tumor and normal pairs. Strong similarities were evident between B-cell lymphomas from golden retrievers and cocker spaniels, with recurrent mutations in TRAF3-MAP3K14 (28\% of all cases), FBXW7 (25\%), and POT1 (17\%). The FBXW7 mutations recurrently occur in a specific codon; the corresponding codon is recurrently mutated in human cancer. In contrast, T-cell lymphomas from the predisposed breeds, boxers and golden retrievers, show little overlap in their mutation pattern, sharing only one of their 15 most recurrently mutated genes. Boxers, which develop aggressive T-cell lymphomas, are typically mutated in the PTEN-mTOR pathway. T-cell lymphomas in golden retrievers are often less aggressive, and their tumors typically showed mutations in genes involved in cellular metabolism. We identify genes with known involvement in human lymphoma and leukemia, genes implicated in other human cancers, as well as novel genes that could allow new therapeutic options.},

  abstract = {MiRNAs can regulate gene expression through versatile mechanisms that result in increased or decreased expression of the targeted mRNA and it could effect the expression of thousands of protein in a particular cell. An increasing body of evidence suggest that miRNAs action can be modulated by proteins that bind to the same 3′UTRs that are targeted by miRNAs, suggesting that other factors apart from miRNAs and their target sites determine miRNA-modulation of gene expression. We applied an affinity purification protocol using biotinylated let-7 miRNA inhibitor to isolate proteins that are involved in let-7 mediated gene regulation that resulted in an affinity purification of Polypyrimidine Tract Binding protein (PTB). Here we show that PTB interacts with miRNAs and human Argonaute 2 (hAgo2) through RNA as well as identified potential mammalian cellular targets that are co-regulated by PTB and hAgo2. In addition, using genetic approach, we have demonstrated that PTB genetically interacts with Caenorhabditis elegans let-7 indicating a conserved role for PTB in miRNA-mediated gene regulation.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: High-grade B-cell lymphoma with MYC and BCL2 and/or BCL6 rearrangements (HGBL-DH/TH) has a poor outcome after standard chemoimmunotherapy. We sought to understand the biologic underpinnings of HGBL-DH/TH with BCL2 rearrangements (HGBL-DH/TH- BCL2) and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) morphology through examination of gene expression. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We analyzed RNA sequencing data from 157 de novo germinal center B-cell-like (GCB)-DLBCLs, including 25 with HGBL-DH/TH- BCL2, to define a gene expression signature that distinguishes HGBL-DH/TH- BCL2 from other GCB-DLBCLs. To assess the genetic, molecular, and phenotypic features associated with this signature, we analyzed targeted resequencing, whole-exome sequencing, RNA sequencing, and immunohistochemistry data. RESULTS: We developed a 104-gene double-hit signature (DHITsig) that assigned 27\% of GCB-DLBCLs to the DHITsig-positive group, with only one half harboring MYC and BCL2 rearrangements (HGBL-DH/TH- BCL2). DHITsig-positive patients had inferior outcomes after rituximab plus cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone immunochemotherapy compared with DHITsig-negative patients (5-year time to progression rate, 57\% and 81\%, respectively; P {$<$} .001), irrespective of HGBL-DH/TH- BCL2 status. The prognostic value of DHITsig was confirmed in an independent validation cohort. DHITsig-positive tumors are biologically characterized by a putative non-light zone germinal center cell of origin and a distinct mutational landscape that comprises genes associated with chromatin modification. A new NanoString assay (DLBCL90) recapitulated the prognostic significance and RNA sequencing assignments. Validating the association with HGBL-DH/TH- BCL2, 11 of 25 DHITsig-positive-transformed follicular lymphomas were classified as HGBL-DH/TH- BCL2 compared with zero of 50 in the DHITsig-negative group. Furthermore, the DHITsig was shared with the majority of B-cell lymphomas with high-grade morphology tested. CONCLUSION: We have defined a clinically and biologically distinct subgroup of tumors within GCB-DLBCL characterized by a gene expression signature of HGBL-DH/TH- BCL2. This knowledge has been translated into an assay applicable to routinely available biopsy samples, which enables exploration of its utility to guide patient management.},

Several pyrimidine-rich sequences are able to substitute for the natural S4 enhancer with various stimulatory effects. We show that the different enhancer sequences recruit U1 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (SnRNP) to the exon 6A 5′ splice site, with an efficiency that correlates with the splicing activation. By using RNA affinity and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, we characterized several proteins that bind to the different enhancer sequences. Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) K and hnRNP I (polypyrimidine track-binding protein, PTB) exhibit a higher level of interaction with the strong enhancer sequences (S4) than with the weakest enhancers. Functional analysis shows that hnRNP K is a component of the enhancer complex that promotes exon 6A splicing through the wild-type S4 sequence. The addition of recombinant hnRNP K to nuclear extracts preincubated with poly(rC) RNA competitor completely restores splicing efficiency to the original level. hnRNP I (PTB) was also found associated with the strong enhancer sequences. Its function in the splicing of exon 6A is discussed.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {The pathogenesis of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), the most common leukemia in adults, is still largely unknown. The full spectrum of genetic lesions that are present in the CLL genome, and therefore the number and identity of dysregulated cellular pathways, have not been identified. By combining next-generation sequencing and copy number analysis, we show here that the typical CLL coding genome contains {$<$}20 clonally represented gene alterations/case, including predominantly nonsilent mutations, and fewer copy number aberrations. These analyses led to the discovery of several genes not previously known to be altered in CLL. Although most of these genes were affected at low frequency in an expanded CLL screening cohort, mutational activation of NOTCH1, observed in 8.3\% of CLL at diagnosis, was detected at significantly higher frequency during disease progression toward Richter transformation (31.0\%), as well as in chemorefractory CLL (20.8\%). Consistent with the association of NOTCH1 mutations with clinically aggressive forms of the disease, NOTCH1 activation at CLL diagnosis emerged as an independent predictor of poor survival. These results provide initial data on the complexity of the CLL coding genome and identify a dysregulated pathway of diagnostic and therapeutic relevance.},

  abstract = {We had previously published the clinical characteristics of a bone fragility disorder in children that was characterized mainly by lower extremity fractures and a mineralization defect in bone tissue but not on the growth plate level. We have now performed whole-exome sequencing on four unrelated individuals with this phenotype. Three individuals were homozygous for a nucleotide change in BMP1, affecting the polyadenylation signal of the transcript that codes for the short isoform of BMP1 (BMP1-1) (c.*241T\&gt;C). In skin fibroblasts of these individuals, we found low levels of BMP1-1 transcript and protein. The fourth individual was compound heterozygous for the c.*241T\&gt;C variant in BMP1-1 and a variant in BMP1 exon 15 (c.2107G\&gt;C) that affected splicing in both BMP1-1 and the long isoform of BMP1 (BMP1-3). Both the homozygous 3′UTR variant and the compound heterozygous variants were associated with impaired procollagen type I C-propeptide cleavage, as the amount of free C-propeptide in the supernatant of skin fibroblasts was less than in controls. Peripheral quantitative computed tomography showed that all individuals had elevated volumetric cortical bone mineral density. Assessment of iliac bone samples by histomorphometry and quantitative backscattered electron imaging indicated that the onset of mineralization at bone formation sites was delayed, but that mineralized matrix was hypermineralized. These results show that isolated lack of BMP1-1 causes bone fragility in children.}

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Exome or whole-genome deep sequencing of tumor DNA along with paired normal DNA can potentially provide a detailed picture of the somatic mutations that characterize the tumor. However, analysis of such sequence data can be complicated by the presence of normal cells in the tumor specimen, by intratumor heterogeneity, and by the sheer size of the raw data. In particular, determination of copy number variations from exome sequencing data alone has proven difficult; thus, single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) arrays have often been used for this task. Recently, algorithms to estimate absolute, but not allele-specific, copy number profiles from tumor sequencing data have been described. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We developed Sequenza, a software package that uses paired tumor-normal DNA sequencing data to estimate tumor cellularity and ploidy, and to calculate allele-specific copy number profiles and mutation profiles. We applied Sequenza, as well as two previously published algorithms, to exome sequence data from 30 tumors from The Cancer Genome Atlas. We assessed the performance of these algorithms by comparing their results with those generated using matched SNP arrays and processed by the allele-specific copy number analysis of tumors (ASCAT) algorithm. RESULTS: Comparison between Sequenza/exome and SNP/ASCAT revealed strong correlation in cellularity (Pearson's r = 0.90) and ploidy estimates (r = 0.42, or r = 0.94 after manual inspecting alternative solutions). This performance was noticeably superior to previously published algorithms. In addition, in artificial data simulating normal-tumor admixtures, Sequenza detected the correct ploidy in samples with tumor content as low as 30\%. CONCLUSIONS: The agreement between Sequenza and SNP array-based copy number profiles suggests that exome sequencing alone is sufficient not only for identifying small scale mutations but also for estimating cellularity and inferring DNA copy number aberrations.},

  abstract = {In recent years, the outcome of mantle cell lymphoma has improved, especially in younger patients, receiving cytarabine-containing chemoimmunotherapy and autologous stem cell transplantation. Nevertheless, a proportion of mantle cell lymphoma patients still experience early failure. To identify biomarkers anticipating failure of intensive chemotherapy in mantle cell lymphoma, we performed target resequencing and DNA profiling of purified tumor samples collected from patients enrolled in the prospective FIL-MCL0208 phase III trial (high-dose chemoimmunotherapy followed by autologous transplantation and randomized lenalidomide maintenance). Mutations of KMT2D and disruption of TP53 by deletion or mutation associated with an increased risk of progression and death, both in univariate and multivariate analysis. By adding KMT2D mutations and TP53 disruption to the MIPI-c backbone, we derived a new prognostic index, the MIPI-genetic. The MIPI-g improved the model discrimination ability compared to the MIPI-c alone, defining three risk groups: i) low-risk patients (4-years progression free survival and overall survival of 72.0\% and 94.5\%); ii) intermediate-risk patients (4-years progression free survival and overall survival of 42.2\% and 65.8\%) and iii) high-risk patients (4-years progression free survival and overall survival of 11.5\% and 44.9\%). Our results: i) confirm that TP53 disruption identifies a high-risk population characterized by poor sensitivity to conventional or intensified chemotherapy; ii) provide the pivotal evidence that patients harboring KMT2D mutations share the same poor outcome as patients harboring TP53 disruption; and iii) allow to develop a tool for the identification of high-risk mantle cell lymphoma patients for whom novel therapeutic strategies need to be investigated.

  abstract = {The mammalian proteins hnRNP A1 and hnRNP H control many splicing decisions in viral and cellular primary transcripts. To explain some of these activities, we have proposed that self-interactions between bound proteins create an RNA loop that represses internal splice sites while simultaneously activating the external sites that are brought in closer proximity. Here we show that a variety of hnRNP H binding sites can affect 5′ splice site selection. The addition of two sets of hnRNP H sites in a model pre-mRNA modulates 5′ splice site selection cooperatively, consistent with the looping model. Notably, binding sites for hnRNP A1 and H on the same pre-mRNA can similarly collaborate to modulate 5′ splice site selection. The C-terminal portion of hnRNP H that contains the glycine-rich domains (GRD) is essential for splicing activity, and it can be functionally replaced by the GRD of hnRNP A1. Finally, we used the bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) technology to document the existence of homotypic and heterotypic interactions between hnRNP H and hnRNP A1 in live cells. Overall, our study suggests that interactions between different hnRNP proteins bound to distinct locations on a pre-mRNA can change its conformation to affect splicing decisions.},

The resultant accumulation of data has increased the need for a normalized and phylogenetic-based nomenclature like those provided for human maternal lineages. Although a standardized classification has been proposed, haplotype names within clades have been assigned gradually without considering the evolutionary history of dog mtDNA. Moreover, this classification is based only on the D-loop region, proven to be insufficient for phylogenetic purposes due to its high number of recurrent mutations and the lack of relevant information present in the coding region. In this study, we design 1) a refined mtDNA cladistic nomenclature from a phylogenetic tree based on complete sequences, classifying dog maternal lineages into haplogroups defined by specific diagnostic mutations, and 2) a coding region SNP analysis that allows a more accurate classification into haplogroups when combined with D-loop sequencing, thus improving the phylogenetic information obtained in dog mitochondrial DNA studies.},

Here, by analyzing in vitro helicase activity, dissociation of UPF1 from purified mRNPs, and transcriptome-wide UPF1 RNA binding, we present the mechanistic basis for inhibition of NMD by PTBP1. Unlike mechanisms of RNA stabilization that depend on direct competition for binding sites among protective RNA-binding proteins and decay factors, PTBP1 promotes displacement of UPF1 already bound to potential substrates. Our results show that PTBP1 directly exploits the tendency of UPF1 to release RNA upon ATP binding and hydrolysis. We further find that UPF1 sensitivity to PTBP1 is coordinated by a regulatory loop in domain 1B of UPF1. We propose that the UPF1 regulatory loop and protective proteins control kinetic proofreading of potential NMD substrates, presenting a new model for RNA helicase regulation and target selection in the NMD pathway.},

  abstract = {The classification of a gene as an oncogene or a tumor suppressor has been a staple of cancer biology for decades. However, as we delve deeper into the biology of these genes, this simple classification has become increasingly difficult for some. In the case of heterogeneous nuclear ribonuclear protein K (hnRNP K), its role as a tumor suppressor has recently been described in acute myeloid leukemia and demonstrated in a haploinsufficient mouse model. In contrast, data from other clinical correlation studies suggest that hnRNP K may be more fittingly described as an oncogene, due to its increased levels in a variety of malignancies. hnRNP K is a multifunctional protein that can regulate both oncogenic and tumor suppressive pathways through a bevy of chromatin-, DNA-, RNA-, and protein-mediated activates, suggesting its aberrant expression may have broad-reaching cellular impacts. In this review, we highlight our current understanding of hnRNP K, with particular emphasis on its apparently dichotomous roles in tumorigenesis.},

Additionally, analysis of samples from primary acute myeloid leukemia patients harboring a partial deletion of chromosome 9 revealed a significant decrease in HNRNPK expression.

  abstract = {Background Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein K (hnRNP~K) is an RNA-binding protein that is aberrantly expressed in cancers. We and others have previously shown that reduced hnRNP~K expression downmodulates tumor-suppressive programs. However, overexpression of hnRNP~K is the more commonly observed clinical phenomenon, yet its functional consequences and clinical significance remain unknown. Methods Clinical implications of hnRNP~K overexpression were examined through immunohistochemistry on samples from patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma who did not harbor MYC alterations (n\,=\,75). A novel transgenic mouse model that overexpresses hnRNP~K specifically in B cells was generated to directly examine the role of hnRNP~K overexpression in mice (three transgenic lines). Molecular consequences of hnRNP~K overexpression were determined through proteomics, formaldehyde-RNA-immunoprecipitation sequencing, and biochemical assays. Therapeutic response to BET-bromodomain inhibition in the context of hnRNP~K overexpression was evaluated in vitro and in vivo (n\,=\,3 per group). All statistical tests were two-sided. Results hnRNP~K is overexpressed in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma patients without MYC genomic alterations. This overexpression is associated with dismal overall survival and progression-free survival (P\,{$<$}\,.001). Overexpression of hnRNP~K in transgenic mice resulted in the development of lymphomas and reduced survival (P\,{$<$}\,.001 for all transgenic lines; Line 171[n\,=\,30]: hazard ratio [HR]\,=\,64.23, 95\% confidence interval [CI]\,=\,26.1 to 158.0; Line 173 [n\,=\,31]: HR\,=\,25.27, 95\% CI\,=\,10.3 to 62.1; Line 177 [n\,=\,25]: HR\,=\,119.5, 95\% CI\,=\,42.7 to 334.2, compared with wild-type mice). Clinical samples, mouse models, global screening assays, and biochemical studies revealed that hnRNP~K’s oncogenic potential stems from its ability to posttranscriptionally and translationally regulate MYC. Consequently, Hnrnpk overexpression renders cells sensitive to BET-bromodomain-inhibition in both in vitro and transplantation models, which represents a strategy for mitigating hnRNP~K-mediated c-Myc activation in patients. Conclusion Our findings indicate that hnRNP~K is a bona fide oncogene when overexpressed and represents a novel mechanism for c-Myc activation in the absence of MYC lesions.},

In addition, these cellular proteins bind to stem-loop IV of the internal ribosomal entry site. The proteins are cytoplasmic and largely associated with ribosomes; they appear to dimerize in solution and to form heterodimers when binding to stem-loop IV. Initiation of viral translation in Xenopus oocytes is strongly inhibited by co-injection of specific antibodies directed against PCBP1 or PCBP2, indicating that the poly(rC) binding proteins may facilitate this process. Furthermore, PCPB-depleted HeLa extracts translate poliovirus RNA inefficiently and the activity is partially restored by addition of recombinant PCBP proteins.},

  abstract = {CREBBP is targeted by inactivating mutations in follicular lymphoma (FL) and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Here, we provide evidence from transgenic mouse models that Crebbp deletion results in deficits in B-cell development and can cooperate with Bcl2 overexpression to promote B-cell lymphoma. Through transcriptional and epigenetic profiling of these B cells, we found that Crebbp inactivation was associated with broad transcriptional alterations, but no changes in the patterns of histone acetylation at the proximal regulatory regions of these genes. However, B cells with Crebbp inactivation showed high expression of Myc and patterns of altered histone acetylation that were localized to intragenic regions, enriched for Myc DNA binding motifs, and showed Myc binding. Through the analysis of CREBBP mutations from a large cohort of primary human FL and DLBCL, we show a significant difference in the spectrum of CREBBP mutations in these 2 diseases, with higher frequencies of nonsense/frameshift mutations in DLBCL compared with FL. Together, our data therefore provide important links between Crebbp inactivation and Bcl2 dependence and show a role for Crebbp inactivation in the induction of Myc expression. We suggest this may parallel the role of CREBBP frameshift/nonsense mutations in DLBCL that result in loss of the protein, but may contrast the role of missense mutations in the lysine acetyltransferase domain that are more frequently observed in FL and yield an inactive protein.},

  abstract = {The proliferation and survival of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) has to be strictly coordinated to ensure the timely production of all blood cells. Here we report that the splice factor and RNA binding protein hnRNP L (heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein L) is required for hematopoiesis, since its genetic ablation in mice reduces almost all blood cell lineages and causes premature death of the animals. In agreement with this, we observed that hnRNP L deficient HSCs lack both the ability to self-renew and foster hematopoietic differentiation in transplanted hosts. They also display mitochondrial dysfunction, elevated levels of γH2AX, are Annexin V positive and incorporate propidium iodide indicating that they undergo cell death. Lin-c-Kit+ fetal liver cells from hnRNP L deficient mice show high p53 protein levels and up-regulation of p53 target genes. In addition, cells lacking hnRNP L up-regulated the expression of the death receptors TrailR2 and CD95/Fas and show Caspase-3, Caspase-8 and Parp cleavage. Treatment with the pan-caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-fmk, but not the deletion of p53, restored cell survival in hnRNP L deficient cells. Our data suggest that hnRNP L is critical for the survival and functional integrity of HSCs by restricting the activation of caspase-dependent death receptor pathways.},

  abstract = {Overexpression of the oncogene HER2 occurs in 20–30\% of invasive breast cancer and is associated with poor prognosis. A number of different splice variants of HER2 have been identified which produce functionally different proteins. Previously these splice variants have been investigated separately, but in the present study we collectively look at the expression and regulation of a group of HER2 splice variants produced by a splicing hotspot. Initial investigation in a cohort of tumor samples showed large variations in HER2 variant expression between patient samples. RNA interference studies identified 2 splicing factors involved in the regulation of splicing within this region, hnRNP H1 and SRSF3. siRNA targeting hnRNP H1 increases levels of X5 and the oncogenic variant Δ16HER2. Furthermore RNA chromatography assays demonstrated binding of hnRNP H1 to RNA in this region. Additionally the proto-oncogene SRSF3 was also identified as an important regulator of splicing with SRSF3 knockdown resulting in changes in all the splice variants located at the hotspot. Most notably knockdown of SRSF3 resulted in a switch from the oncogenic Δ16HER2 to p100 which inhibits cell proliferation. Binding of SRSF3 to RNA within this region was also demonstrated by RNA chromatography and more specifically 2 SRSF3 binding sites were identified within exon 15. SRSF3 and hnRNP H1 are the first splicing factors identified which regulate the production of these functionally distinct HER2 splice variants and therefore maybe important for the regulation of HER2 signaling.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma (PMBL) is a distinct subtype of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) frequently observed in young patients. High-dose immunochemotherapy constitutes the current therapeutic gold-standard, despite significant toxicity and serious late effects. Several hotspots harboring oncogenic gain-of-function mutations were recently shown to pose vital hallmarks in activated B-cell like (ABC-) (CD79B, CARD11 and MYD88) and germinal center like (GCB-) DLBCL (EZH2), respectively. Several promising targeted-therapy approaches, derived from these findings, are currently under development. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We thoroughly characterized a cohort of 25 untreated patients with de novo PMBL by immunohistochemical and cytogenetic means and assessed the prevalence of activating mutations affecting EZH2, CD79B and CARD11 utilizing a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based capillary sequencing approach. Moreover, the MYD88 p. L265P status was assessed by employing a pyrosequencing approach. RESULTS: PMBLs included in this study did not harbor any of the reported hotspot mutations activating the nuclear factor (NF)-kappa B signaling cascade or the EZH2-mediated epigenetic deregulation of gene expression. Immunohistochemical characterization revealed an ABC phenotype in 44\% (n=11) of cases. CONCLUSION: We report that genetic alterations of these genes are rare events in PMBL unlike other subtypes of DLBCL. Our findings suggest that a substantial subset of PMBL patients may benefit from treatment approaches targeting BCR-mediated activation of NF-kappa B.},

Of particular interest are regions of differential methylation between parental alleles, as these often dictate monoallelic gene expression, resulting in parent of origin specific control of the embryonic transcriptome and subsequent development, in a phenomenon known as genomic imprinting. Using long-read nanopore sequencing we show that, with an average genomic coverage of ∼10, it is possible to determine both the level of methylation of CpG sites and the haplotype from which each read arises. The long-read property is exploited to characterize, using novel methods, both methylation and haplotype for reads that have reduced basecalling precision compared to Sanger sequencing. We validate the analysis both through comparison of nanopore-derived methylation patterns with those from Reduced Representation Bisulfite Sequencing data and through comparison with previously reported data. Our analysis successfully identifies known imprinting control regions (ICRs) as well as some novel differentially methylated regions which, due to their proximity to hitherto unknown monoallelically expressed genes, may represent new ICRs.},

Salvage regimens have never been compared; their efficacy in the rituximab era is unknown. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with CD20(+) DLBCL in first relapse or who were refractory after first-line therapy were randomly assigned to either rituximab, ifosfamide, etoposide, and carboplatin (R-ICE) or rituximab, dexamethasone, high-dose cytarabine, and cisplatin (R-DHAP). Responding patients received high-dose chemotherapy and ASCT. RESULTS: The median age of the 396 patients enrolled (R-ICE, n = 202; R-DHAP, n = 194) was 55 years. Similar response rates were observed after three cycles of R-ICE (63.5\%; 95\% CI, 56\% to 70\%) and R-DHAP (62.8\%; 95 CI, 55\% to 69\%). Factors affecting response rates (P {$<$} .001) were refractory disease/relapse less than versus more than 12 months after diagnosis (46\% v 88\%, respectively), International Prognostic Index (IPI) of more than 1 versus 0 to 1 (52\% v 71\%, respectively), and prior rituximab treatment versus no prior rituximab (51\% v 83\%, respectively). There was no significant difference between R-ICE and R-DHAP for 3-year event-free survival (EFS) or overall survival. Three-year EFS was affected by prior rituximab treatment versus no rituximab (21\% v 47\%, respectively), relapse less than versus more than 12 months after diagnosis (20\% v 45\%, respectively), and IPI of 2 to 3 versus 0 to 1 (18\% v 40\%, respectively). In the Cox model, these parameters were significant (P {$<$} .001). CONCLUSION: In patients who experience relapse more than 12 months after diagnosis, prior rituximab treatment does not affect EFS. Patients with early relapses after rituximab-containing first-line therapy have a poor prognosis, with no difference between the effects of R-ICE and R-DHAP.},

Conversely, patients who harbor deletions of the HNRNPA2B1 gene show better prognosis than average. Knockdown of hnRNP A2/B1 in glioblastoma cells inhibited tumor formation in mice. In contrast, overexpression of hnRNP A2/B1 in immortal cells led to malignant transformation, suggesting that HNRNPA2B1 is a putative proto-oncogene. We then identified several tumor suppressors and oncogenes that are regulated by HNRNPA2B1, among them are c-FLIP, BIN1, and WWOX, and the proto-oncogene RON. Knockdown of RON inhibited hnRNP A2/B1 mediated transformation, which implied that RON is one of the mediators of HNRNPA2B1 oncogenic activity.

CD16B is highly homologous to CD16A and a major FcγR on human polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs). We show here that glycoengineered obinutuzumab or rituximab bound CD16B with approximately sevenfold higher affinity, compared with nonglycoengineered wild-type parental antibodies. Furthermore, glycoengineered obinutuzumab activated PMNs, either purified or in chronic lymphoblastic leukemia whole blood, more efficiently than wild-type rituximab. Activation resulted in a 50\% increase in CD11b expression and 70\% down-modulation of CD62L on neutrophils and in release of tumor necrosis factor alpha, IL-6, and IL-8. Activation was not accompanied by generation of reactive oxygen species or antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity activity, but led to up to 47\% phagocytosis of glycoengineered anti-CD20 opsonized chronic lymphoblastic leukemia targets by purified PMNs. Significant phagocytosis was observed in whole blood, but only in the presence of glycoengineered antibodies, and was followed by up to 50\% PMN death. Finally we show, using anti-CD16B and anti-CD32A Fab and F(ab’)2 fragments, that both of these receptors are involved in PMN activation, phagocytosis, and cell death induced by glycoengineered antibodies. We conclude that phagocytosis by PMNs is an additional mechanism of action of obinutuzumab mediated through its higher binding affinity for CD16B.}

  abstract = {The malignant Hodgkin and Reed Sternberg (HRS) cells of classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL) are scarce in affected lymph nodes, creating a challenge to detect driver somatic mutations. As an alternative to cell purification techniques, we hypothesized that ultra-deep exome sequencing would allow genomic study of HRS cells, thereby streamlining analysis and avoiding technical pitfalls. To test this, 31 cHL tumor/normal pairs were exome sequenced to approximately 1,000× median depth of coverage. An orthogonal error-corrected sequencing approach verified {$>$}95\% of the discovered mutations. We identified mutations in genes novel to cHL including: CDH5 and PCDH7, novel stop gain mutations in IL4R, and a novel pattern of recurrent mutations in pathways regulating Hippo signaling. As a further application of our exome sequencing, we attempted to identify expressed somatic single-nucleotide variants (SNV) in single-nuclei RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) data generated from a patient in our cohort. Our snRNA analysis identified a clear cluster of cells containing a somatic SNV identified in our deep exome data. This cluster has differentially expressed genes that are consistent with genes known to be dysregulated in HRS cells (e.g., PIM1 and PIM3). The cluster also contains cells with an expanded B-cell clonotype further supporting a malignant phenotype. This study provides proof-of-principle that ultra-deep exome sequencing can be utilized to identify recurrent mutations in HRS cells and demonstrates the feasibility of snRNA-seq in the context of cHL. These studies provide the foundation for the further analysis of genomic variants in large cohorts of patients with cHL. SIGNIFICANCE: Our data demonstrate the utility of ultra-deep exome sequencing in uncovering somatic variants in Hodgkin lymphoma, creating new opportunities to define the genes that are recurrently mutated in this disease. We also show for the first time the successful application of snRNA-seq in Hodgkin lymphoma and describe the expression profile of a putative cluster of HRS cells in a single patient.},

  abstract = {DDX3X is a ubiquitously expressed RNA helicase involved in multiple stages of RNA biogenesis. DDX3X is frequently mutated in Burkitt lymphoma, but the functional basis for this is unknown. Here, we show that loss-of-function DDX3X mutations are also enriched in MYC-translocated diffuse large B cell lymphoma and reveal functional cooperation between mutant DDX3X and MYC. DDX3X promotes the translation of mRNA encoding components of the core translational machinery, thereby driving global protein synthesis. Loss-of-function DDX3X mutations moderate MYC-driven global protein synthesis, thereby buffering MYC-induced proteotoxic stress during early lymphomagenesis. Established lymphoma cells restore full protein synthetic capacity by aberrant expression of DDX3Y, a Y chromosome homolog, the expression of which is normally restricted to the testis. These findings show that DDX3X loss of function can buffer MYC-driven proteotoxic stress and highlight the capacity of male B cell lymphomas to then compensate for this loss by ectopic DDX3Y expression.},

  abstract = {Identifying cancer driver genes and pathways among all somatic mutations detected in a cohort of tumors is a key challenge in cancer genomics. Traditionally, this is done by prioritizing genes according to the recurrence of alterations that they bear. However, this approach has some known limitations, such as the difficulty to correctly estimate the background mutation rate, and the fact that it cannot identify lowly recurrently mutated driver genes. Here we present a novel approach, Oncodrive-fm, to detect candidate cancer drivers which does not rely on recurrence. First, we hypothesized that any bias toward the accumulation of variants with high functional impact observed in a gene or group of genes may be an indication of positive selection and can thus be used to detect candidate driver genes or gene modules. Next, we developed a method to measure this bias (FM bias) and applied it to three datasets of tumor somatic variants. As a proof of concept of our hypothesis we show that most of the highly recurrent and well-known cancer genes exhibit a clear FM bias. Moreover, this novel approach avoids some known limitations of recurrence-based approaches, and can successfully identify lowly recurrent candidate cancer drivers.},

  abstract = {The hnRNP C proteins (C1/C2) are tenacious nuclear pre-mRNA-binding proteins that belong to the large RNP motif family of RNA-binding proteins. This motif identifies an RNA-binding domain (RBD) that consists of a four-stranded antiparallel beta-sheet packed against two alpha-helices. Despite considerable information on the structure of the hnRNP C RBD, little is known about its RNA-binding properties. To address this we used in vitro selection/amplification from pools of random sequence RNA to determine the RNA-binding specificity of hnRNP C1. After 8 rounds of selection/amplification nearly all RNAs contained contiguous stretches of at least 5 U residues, and filter-binding assays demonstrated that this sequence constitutes a high-affinity (Kd = 170 nM) binding site for hnRNP C1. The highest affinity we measured for hnRNP C1 was for r(U)14 (Kd = 14 nM). An RBD-containing peptide fragment of hnRNP C1 (amino acids 2-94) bound oligoribonucleotides containing an hnRNP C1 high-affinity binding site with nearly equal affinity to that of hnRNP C1. Unlike hnRNP C1, however, this peptide also bound oligoribonucleotides that do not contain high-affinity hnRNP C1-binding sites. We identified a region of 10 amino acids, immediately COOH-terminal to the RNP motif (amino acids 95-104), that prevents the minimal RBD from binding nonspecific RNA ligands. We propose that the highly conserved beta alpha beta beta alpha beta core structure of the RNP motif RBD confers a general RNA binding activity to RNP motif RBDs and that the determinants of RNA-binding specificity reside in the most variable regions, the loops connecting the beta-strands and/or the contiguous NH2 and COOH termini of the RBD.},

  abstract = {Massively parallel sequencing of cDNA has enabled deep and efficient probing of transcriptomes. Current approaches for transcript reconstruction from such data often rely on aligning reads to a reference genome, and are thus unsuitable for samples with a partial or missing reference genome. Here we present the Trinity method for de novo assembly of full-length transcripts and evaluate it on samples from fission yeast, mouse and whitefly, whose reference genome is not yet available. By efficiently constructing and analyzing sets of de Bruijn graphs, Trinity fully reconstructs a large fraction of transcripts, including alternatively spliced isoforms and transcripts from recently duplicated genes. Compared with other de novo transcriptome assemblers, Trinity recovers more full-length transcripts across a broad range of expression levels, with a sensitivity similar to methods that rely on genome alignments. Our approach provides a unified solution for transcriptome reconstruction in any sample, especially in the absence of a reference genome.}

However, the RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) controlling this splicing event are unknown. Here, using affinity pull-down analysis, we identified heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins H1 and H2(HNRNPH) as RBPs specifically capable of interacting with the spliced RNA segment (exon 7) of Trf2 pre-mRNA. HNRNPH proteins prevent the production of the short isoform of Trf2 mRNA, as HNRNPH silencing selectively elevates TRF2-S levels. Accordingly, HNRNPH levels decline while TRF2-S levels increase during neuronal differentiation. In addition, CRISPR/Cas9-mediated deletion of hnRNPH2 selectively accelerates the NGF-triggered differentiation of rat pheochromocytoma cells into neurons. In sum, HNRNPH is a splicing regulator of Trf2 pre-mRNA that prevents the expression of TRF2-S, a factor implicated in neuronal differentiation.},

  abstract = {The epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), in which cells undergo a switch from a polarized, epithelial phenotype to a highly motile fibroblastic or mesenchymal phenotype is fundamental during embryonic development and can be reactivated in a variety of diseases including cancer. Spatio-temporally-regulated mechanisms are constantly orchestrated to allow cells to adapt to their constantly changing environments when disseminating to distant organs. Although numerous transcriptional regulatory factors are currently wellcharacterized, the post-transcriptional control of EMT requires continued investigation. The hnRNP E1 protein displays a major role in the control of tumor cell plasticity by regulating the translatome through multiple nonredundant mechanisms, and this role is exemplified when E1 is absent. hnRNP E1 binding to RNA molecules leads to direct or indirect translational regulation of specific sets of proteins: (1) hnRNP E1 binding to specific targets has a direct role in translation by preventing elongation of translation; (2) hnRNP E1-dependent alternative splicing can prevent the generation of a competing long non-coding RNA that acts as a decoy for microRNAs (miRNAs) involved in translational inhibition of EMT master regulators; (3) hnRNP E1 binding to the 3’ untranslated region of transcripts can also positively regulate the stability of certain mRNAs to improve their translation. Globally, hnRNP E1 appears to control proteome reprogramming during cell plasticity, either by direct or indirect regulation of protein translation.},

Ewing sarcoma is a highly aggressive cancer, with a survival of 70-80\% for patients with standard-risk and localized disease and \textasciitilde 30\% for those with metastatic disease. Treatment comprises local surgery, radiotherapy and polychemotherapy, which are associated with acute and chronic adverse effects that may compromise quality of life in survivors. Histologically, Ewing sarcomas are composed of small round cells expressing high levels of CD99. Genetically, they are characterized by balanced chromosomal translocations in which a member of the FET gene family is fused with an ETS transcription factor, with the most common fusion being EWSR1-FLI1 (85\% of cases). Ewing sarcoma breakpoint region 1 protein (EWSR1)-Friend leukaemia integration 1 transcription factor (FLI1) is a tumour-specific chimeric transcription factor (EWSR1-FLI1) with neomorphic effects that massively rewires the transcriptome. Additionally, EWSR1-FLI1 reprogrammes the epigenome by inducing de novo enhancers at GGAA microsatellites and by altering the state of gene regulatory elements, creating a unique epigenetic signature. Additional mutations at diagnosis are rare and mainly involve STAG2, TP53 and CDKN2A deletions. Emerging studies on the molecular mechanisms of Ewing sarcoma hold promise for improvements in early detection, disease monitoring, lower treatment-related toxicity, overall survival and quality of life.},

  abstract = {De novo assembly of RNA-seq data enables researchers to study transcriptomes without the need for a genome sequence; this approach can be usefully applied, for instance, in research on 'non-model organisms' of ecological and evolutionary importance, cancer samples or the microbiome. In this protocol we describe the use of the Trinity platform for de novo transcriptome assembly from RNA-seq data in non-model organisms. We also present Trinity-supported companion utilities for downstream applications, including RSEM for transcript abundance estimation, R/Bioconductor packages for identifying differentially expressed transcripts across samples and approaches to identify protein-coding genes. In the procedure, we provide a workflow for genome-independent transcriptome analysis leveraging the Trinity platform. The software, documentation and demonstrations are freely available from http://trinityrnaseq.sourceforge.net. The run time of this protocol is highly dependent on the size and complexity of data to be analyzed. The example data set analyzed in the procedure detailed herein can be processed in less than 5 h.}

  abstract = {Deregulated expression of the Myc family of transcription factors (c-, N-, and L-myc) contributes to the development of many cancers by a mechanism believed to involve the stimulation of cell proliferation and inhibition of differentiation. However, using B cell–specific c-/N-myc double-knockout mice and Eμ-myc transgenic mice bred onto genetic backgrounds (recombinase-activating gene 2−/− and Btk−/− Tec−/−) whereby B cell development is arrested, we show that Myc is necessary to stimulate both proliferation and differentiation in primary B cells. Moreover, Myc expression results in sustained increases in intracellular Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i), which is required for Myc to stimulate B cell proliferation and differentiation. The increase in [Ca2+]i correlates with constitutive nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) nuclear translocation, reduced Ca2+ efflux, and decreased expression of the plasma membrane Ca2+–adenosine triphosphatase (PMCA) efflux pump. Our findings demonstrate a revised model whereby Myc promotes both proliferation and differentiation, in part by a remarkable mechanism whereby Myc amplifies Ca2+ signals, thereby enabling the concurrent expression of Myc- and Ca2+-regulated target genes.},

Many thousands of such samples exist and could be used for next generation sequencing analysis. Retrospective analyses of such samples are important for identifying molecular correlates of carcinogenesis, treatment history and disease outcomes. Two major hurdles in using FFPE material for sequencing are the damaged nature of the nucleic acids and the labor-intensive nature of nucleic acid purification. These limitations and a number of other issues that span multiple steps from nucleic acid purification to library construction are addressed here. We optimized and automated a 96-well magnetic bead-based extraction protocol that can be scaled to large cohorts and is compatible with automation. Using sets of 32 and 91 individual FFPE samples respectively, we generated libraries from 100 ng of total RNA and DNA starting amounts with 95-100\% success rate. The use of the resulting RNA in micro-RNA sequencing was also demonstrated. In addition to offering the potential of scalability and rapid throughput, the yield obtained with lower input requirements makes these methods applicable to clinical samples where tissue abundance is limiting.},

  abstract = {RNA sequencing (RNAseq) has been widely used to generate bulk gene expression measurements collected from pools of cells. Only relatively recently have single-cell RNAseq (scRNAseq) methods provided opportunities for gene expression analyses at the single-cell level, allowing researchers to study heterogeneous mixtures of cells at unprecedented resolution. Tumors tend to be composed of heterogeneous cellular mixtures and are frequently the subjects of such analyses. Extensive method developments have led to several protocols for scRNAseq but, owing to the small amounts of RNA in single cells, technical constraints have required compromises. For example, the majority of scRNAseq methods are limited to sequencing only the 3' or 5' termini of transcripts. Other protocols that facilitate full-length transcript profiling tend to capture only polyadenylated mRNAs and are generally limited to processing only 96 cells at a time. Here, we address these limitations and present a novel protocol that allows for the high-throughput sequencing of full-length, total RNA at single-cell resolution. We demonstrate that our method produced strand-specific sequencing data for both polyadenylated and non-polyadenylated transcripts, enabled the profiling of transcript regions beyond only transcript termini, and yielded data rich enough to allow identification of cell types from heterogeneous biological samples.},

One important consideration in repurposing FFPE material for next generation sequencing (NGS) analysis is the sequencing artifacts that can arise from the significant damage to nucleic acids due to treatment with formalin, storage at room temperature and extraction. One such class of artifacts consists of chimeric reads that appear to be derived from non-contiguous portions of the genome. Here, we show that a major proportion of such chimeric reads align to both the 'Watson' and 'Crick' strands of the reference genome. We refer to these as strand-split artifact reads (SSARs). This study provides a conceptual framework for the mechanistic basis of the genesis of SSARs and other chimeric artifacts along with supporting experimental evidence, which have led to approaches to reduce the levels of such artifacts. We demonstrate that one of these approaches, involving S1 nuclease-mediated removal of single-stranded fragments and overhangs, also reduces sequence bias, base error rates, and false positive detection of copy number and single nucleotide variants. Finally, we describe an analytical approach for quantifying SSARs from NGS data.},

Tissue microarray (TMA) blocks were created from 152 cases of DLBCL, 142 of which had been successfully evaluated by cDNA microarray (75 GCB, 41 ABC, and 26 type 3). Sections were stained with antibodies to CD10, bcl-6, MUM1, FOXP1, cyclin D2, and bcl-2. Expression of bcl-6 (P {$<$} .001) or CD10 (P = .019) was associated with better overall survival (OS), whereas expression of MUM1 (P = .009) or cyclin D2 (P {$<$} .001) was associated with worse OS. Cases were subclassified using CD10, bcl-6, and MUM1 expression, and 64 cases (42\%) were considered GCB and 88 cases (58\%) non-GCB. The 5-year OS for the GCB group was 76\% compared with only 34\% for the non-GCB group (P {$<$} .001), which is similar to that reported using the cDNA microarray. Bcl-2 and cyclin D2 were adverse predictors in the non-GCB group. In multivariate analysis, a high International Prognostic Index score (3-5) and the non-GCB phenotype were independent adverse predictors (P {$<$} .0001). In summary, immunostains can be used to determine the GCB and non-GCB subtypes of DLBCL and predict survival similar to the cDNA microarray.}

  abstract = {Cancer immunotherapy has been revolutionised by the use monoclonal antibodies (mAb) that function through their interaction with Fc gamma receptors (FcγRs). The low-affinity FcγR genes are highly homologous, map to a complex locus at 1p23 and harbour single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and copy number variation (CNV) that can impact on receptor function and response to therapeutic mAbs. This complexity can hinder accurate characterisation of the locus. We therefore evaluated and optimised a suite of assays for the genomic analysis of the FcγR locus amenable to peripheral blood mononuclear cells and formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) material that can be employed in a high-throughput manner. Assessment of TaqMan genotyping for FCGR2A-131H/R, FCGR3A-158F/V and FCGR2B-232I/T SNPs demonstrated the need for additional methods to discriminate genotypes for the FCGR3A-158F/V and FCGR2B-232I/T SNPs due to sequence homology and CNV in the region. A multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification assay provided high quality SNP and CNV data in PBMC cases, but there was greater data variability in FFPE material in a manner that was predicted by the BIOMED-2 multiplex PCR protocol. In conclusion, we have evaluated a suite of assays for the genomic analysis of the FcγR locus that are scalable for application in large clinical trials of mAb therapy. These assays will ultimately help establish the importance of FcγR genetics in predicting response to antibody therapeutics.}

In contrast, optimal FcγR engagement facilitates effective disease resolution and response to monoclonal antibody immunotherapy. The underlying genetics of the FcγR gene family are a central component of this careful balance.

In this study, we evaluated acalabrutinib in spontaneously occurring canine lymphoma, a model of B-cell malignancy similar to human diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). First, we demonstrated that acalabrutinib potently inhibited BTK activity and downstream effectors in CLBL1, a canine B-cell lymphoma cell line, and primary canine lymphoma cells. Acalabrutinib also inhibited proliferation in CLBL1 cells. Twenty dogs were enrolled in the clinical trial and treated with acalabrutinib at dosages of 2.5 to 20mg/kg every 12 or 24 hours. Acalabrutinib was generally well tolerated, with adverse events consisting primarily of grade 1 or 2 anorexia, weight loss, vomiting, diarrhea and lethargy. Overall response rate (ORR) was 25\% (5/20) with a median progression free survival (PFS) of 22.5 days. Clinical benefit was observed in 30\% (6/20) of dogs. These findings suggest that acalabrutinib is safe and exhibits activity in canine B-cell lymphoma patients and support the use of canine lymphoma as a relevant model for human non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL).},

This complexity has created confusion with respect to the various bacterial and parasitic infections associated with the disease and its significance in dogs in specific geographical locations has likely to have previously been under-estimated. This paper addresses the history, taxonomy, microbiology of N. helminthoeca and summarises the pathogenesis, clinical signs and pathological features associated with infection.

These innovative targeting molecules have attracted an increasing interest in the biomedical field. Compared to traditional protein antibodies, aptamers have several advantages, such as small size, high binding affinity, specificity, good biocompatibility, high stability and low immunogenicity, which all contribute to their wide application in the biomedical field. Aptamers can bind to the receptors on the cell membrane and mediate themselves or conjugated nanoparticles to enter into cells. Therefore, aptamers can be served as ideal targeting ligands for drug delivery. Since their excellent properties, different aptamer-mediated drug delivery systems had been developed for cancer therapy. This review provides a brief overview of recent advances in drug delivery systems based on aptamers. The advantages, challenges and future prospectives are also discussed.},

  abstract = {Gastric cancer (GC) is a heterogeneous disease, so molecular classification is important for selecting the most appropriate treatment strategies for GC patients. To be applicable in the clinic, there is an urgent need for a platform that will allow screening real-life archival tissue specimens. For this purpose, we performed RNA sequencing of 50 samples from our Asian Cancer Research Group (ACRG) GC cohort to reproduce the molecular subtypes of GC using archival tissues with different platforms. We filtered out genes from the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and microsatellite instability-high (MSI) signatures (coefficient\,≤\,0.4) followed by the ACRG molecular subtype strategy. Overall accuracy of reproduction of ACRG subtype was 66\% (33/50). Given the importance of EMT subtype in future clinical trials, we further developed the minimum number of genes (10 genes) for EMT signatures correlating highly with the original EMT signatures (correlation\,≥\,0.65). Using our 10-gene model, we could classify EMT subtypes with high sensitivity (0.9576) and specificity (0.811). In conclusion, we reproduced ACRG GC subtypes using different platforms and could predict EMT subtypes with 10 genes and are now planning to use them in our prospective clinical study of precision oncology in GC.},

  abstract = {Philadelphia-like B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph-like ALL) is characterized by distinct genetic alterations and inferior prognosis in children and younger adults. The purpose of this study was a genetic and clinical characterization of Ph-like ALL in adults. Twenty-six (13\%) of 207 adult patients (median age: 42 years) with B-cell precursor ALL (BCP-ALL) were classified as having Ph-like ALL using gene expression profiling. The frequency of Ph-like ALL was 27\% among 95 BCP-ALL patients negative for BCR-ABL1 and KMT2A-rearrangements. IGH-CRLF2 rearrangements (6/16; P=0.002) and mutations in JAK2 (7/16; P{$<$}0.001) were found exclusively in the Ph-like ALL subgroup. Clinical and outcome analyses were restricted to patients treated in German Multicenter Study Group for Adult ALL (GMALL) trials 06/99 and 07/03 (n=107). The complete remission rate was 100\% among both Ph-like ALL patients (n=19) and the “remaining BCP-ALL” cases (n=40), i.e. patients negative for BCR-ABL1 and KMT2A-rearrangements and the Ph-like subtype. Significantly fewer Ph-like ALL patients reached molecular complete remission (33\% versus 79\%; P=0.02) and had a lower probability of continuous complete remission (26\% versus 60\%; P=0.03) and overall survival (22\% versus 64\%; P=0.006) at 5 years compared to the remaining BCP-ALL patients. The profile of genetic lesions in adults with Ph-like ALL, including older adults, resembles that of pediatric Ph-like ALL and differs from the profile in the remaining BCP-ALL. Our study is the first to demonstrate that Ph-like ALL is associated with inferior outcomes in intensively treated older adult patients. Ph-like adult ALL should be recognized as a distinct, high-risk entity and further research on improved diagnostic and therapeutic approaches is needed. (NCT00199056, NCT00198991)},

Although the functions of wild-type FUS are unknown, the protein contains an RNA-recognition motif and is a component of nuclear riboprotein complexes4,5. FUS resembles a transcription factor in that it binds DNA, contributes a transcriptional activation domain to the FUS–ERG oncoprotein and interacts with several transcription factors in vitro6,7,8. To better understand FUS function in vivo, we examined the consequences of disrupting  Fus in mice. Our results indicate that Fus is essential for viability of neonatal animals, influences lymphocyte development in a non-cell-intrinsic manner, has an intrinsic role in the proliferative responses of B cells to specific mitogenic stimuli and is required for the maintenance of genomic stability. The involvement of a nuclear riboprotein in these processes  in vivo indicates that Fus is important in genome maintenance.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is cured in more than 60\% of patients, but outcomes remain poor for patients experiencing disease progression or relapse (refractory or relapsed DLBCL [rrDLBCL]), particularly if these events occur early. Although previous studies examining cohorts of rrDLBCL have identified features that are enriched at relapse, few have directly compared serial biopsies to uncover biological and evolutionary dynamics driving rrDLBCL. Here, we sought to confirm the relationship between relapse timing and outcomes after second-line (immuno)chemotherapy and determine the evolutionary dynamics that underpin that relationship. PATIENTS AND METHODS Outcomes were examined in a population-based cohort of 221 patients with DLBCL who experienced progression/relapse after frontline treatment and were treated with second-line (immuno)chemotherapy with an intention-to-treat with autologous stem-cell transplantation (ASCT). Serial DLBCL biopsies from a partially overlapping cohort of 129 patients underwent molecular characterization, including whole-genome or whole-exome sequencing in 73 patients. RESULTS Outcomes to second-line therapy and ASCT are superior for late relapse ({$>$}2 years postdiagnosis) versus primary refractory ({$<$}9 months) or early relapse (9-24 months). Diagnostic and relapse biopsies were mostly concordant for cell-of-origin classification and genetics-based subgroup. Despite this concordance, the number of mutations exclusive to each biopsy increased with time since diagnosis, and late relapses shared few mutations with their diagnostic counterpart, demonstrating a branching evolution pattern. In patients with highly divergent tumors, many of the same genes acquired new mutations independently in each tumor, suggesting that the earliest mutations in a shared precursor cell constrain tumor evolution toward the same genetics-based subgroups at both diagnosis and relapse. CONCLUSION These results suggest that late relapses commonly represent genetically distinct and chemotherapy-naïve disease and have implications for optimal patient management.},

  abstract = {Approximately 30\% of alleles causing genetic disorders generate premature termination codons (PTCs), which are usually associated with severe phenotypes. However, bypassing the deleterious stop codon can lead to a mild disease outcome. Splicing at NAGNAG tandem splice sites has been reported to result in insertion or deletion (indel) of three nucleotides. We identified such a mechanism as the origin of the mild to asymptomatic phenotype observed in cystic fibrosis patients homozygous for the E831X mutation (2623G{$>$}T) in the CFTR gene. Analyses performed on nasal epithelial cell mRNA detected three distinct isoforms, a considerably more complex situation than expected for a single nucleotide substitution. Structure-function studies and in silico analyses provided the first experimental evidence of an indel of a stop codon by alternative splicing at a NAGNAG acceptor site. In addition to contributing to proteome plasticity, alternative splicing at a NAGNAG tandem site can thus remove a disease-causing UAG stop codon. This molecular study reveals a naturally occurring mechanism where the effect of either modifier genes or epigenetic factors could be suspected. This finding is of importance for genetic counseling as well as for deciding appropriate therapeutic strategies.},

  abstract = {RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) regulate fundamental processes, such as differentiation and self-renewal, by enabling the dynamic control of protein abundance or isoforms or through the regulation of noncoding RNA. RBPs are increasingly appreciated as being essential for normal hematopoiesis, and they are understood to play fundamental roles in hematological malignancies by acting as oncogenes or tumor suppressors. Alternative splicing has been shown to play roles in the development of specific hematopoietic lineages, and sequence-specific mutations in RBPs lead to dysregulated splicing in myeloid and lymphoid leukemias. RBPs that regulate translation contribute to the development and function of hematological lineages, act as nodes for the action of multiple signaling pathways, and contribute to hematological malignancies. These insights broaden our mechanistic understanding of the molecular regulation of hematopoiesis and offer opportunities to develop disease biomarkers and new therapeutic modalities.}

We found that in myeloma cell lines, MYC gene amplifications were common and correlated with MYC mRNA and protein. In primary cell samples MYC mRNA levels were also relatively high; however gene copy number alterations were uncommon. Elevated levels of MYC in primary myeloma cells have been reported to arise from complex genetic aberrations and are more common than previously thought. Thus, elevated MYC expression is achieved differently in myeloma cell lines and primary cells. Sensitivity of myeloma cell lines to the MYC inhibitor 10058-F4 correlated with MYC expression, supporting that the activity of 10058-F4 was through specific inhibition of MYC.},

In development and progression of carcinogenesis, RBPs are aberrantly dysregulated in many human cancers with various mechanisms, such as genetic alteration, epigenetic change, noncoding RNA-mediated regulation, and post-translational modifications. Upon deregulation in cancers, RBPs influence every step in the development and progression of cancer, including sustained cell proliferation, evasion of apoptosis, avoiding immune surveillance, inducing angiogenesis, and activating metastasis. To develop therapeutic strategies targeting RBPs, RNA interference-based oligonucleotides or small molecule inhibitors have been screened based on reduced RBP-RNA interaction and changed level of target RNAs.

The Bruton tyrosine kinase (Btk) is specifically required for BCR signaling as demonstrated by human and mouse mutations that disrupt Btk function and prevent B-cell maturation at steps that require a functional BCR pathway. Herein we describe a selective and irreversible Btk inhibitor, PCI-32765, that is currently under clinical development in patients with B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma. We have used this inhibitor to investigate the biologic effects of Btk inhibition on mature B-cell function and the progression of B cell-associated diseases in vivo. PCI-32765 blocked BCR signaling in human peripheral B cells at concentrations that did not affect T cell receptor signaling. In mice with collagen-induced arthritis, orally administered PCI-32765 reduced the level of circulating autoantibodies and completely suppressed disease. PCI-32765 also inhibited autoantibody production and the development of kidney disease in the MRL-Fas(lpr) lupus model. Occupancy of the Btk active site by PCI-32765 was monitored in vitro and in vivo using a fluorescent affinity probe for Btk. Active site occupancy of Btk was tightly correlated with the blockade of BCR signaling and in vivo efficacy. Finally, PCI-32765 induced objective clinical responses in dogs with spontaneous B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma. These findings support Btk inhibition as a therapeutic approach for the treatment of human diseases associated with activation of the BCR pathway.},

These proteins share epitopes and sequence identity with two other proteins, isoelectric focusing sample spot numbers 2222 (37.6 kDa; pI 6.5) and 2326 (39.5 kDa; pI 6.6), indicating that the subfamily may contain additional members. The identity between hnRNPs H and H' is 96\%, between H and F 78\%, and between H' and F 75\%, respectively. The three proteins contain three repeats, which we denote quasi-RRMs (qRRMs) since they have a remote similarity to the RNA recognition motif (RRM). The three qRRMs of hnRNP H, with a few additional NH2-terminal amino acids, were constructed by polymerase chain reaction amplification and used for ribohomopolymer binding studies. Each qRRM repeat bound poly(rG), while only the NH2-terminal qRRM bound poly(rC) and poly(rU). None of the repeats bound detectable amounts of poly(rA). The expression levels of hnRNPs H and F were differentially regulated in pairs of normal and transformed fibroblasts and keratinocytes. In normal human keratinocytes, the expression level of H was unaffected by treatment with several substances tested including two second messengers and seven cytokines. Likewise the expression level of F was independent of these substances, although it was strikingly down-regulated by long term treatment with 4 beta-phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, indicating that the protein kinase C signaling pathway regulates its expression. No effect of 4 beta-phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate was observed on the expression of hnRNP H. The genes coding for hnRNPs H, H', and F were chromosome-mapped to 5q35.3 (HNRPH1), 6q25.3-q26, and/or Xq22 (HNRPH2) and 10q11.21-q11.22 (HNRPF), respectively.},

We have compared a set of tissues and found striking differences in their levels of expression as well as in the nuclear versus the cytoplasmic distribution. Generally, hnRNP F is broadly expressed in many tissues with extremely strong expression in the prostate gland while hnRNP H/H' shows a more restricted degree of expression with low expression in some tissues, for example, liver, exocrine acini of the pancreas, thyroid gland and heart. At the cellular level, hnRNP F is, with few exceptions, predominantly expressed in the cytoplasm while hnRNP H/H' is more abundant in the nuclei. A quite pronounced heterogeneous expression pattern is seen in the proximal tubules of the kidney where hnRNP F is present at moderate cytoplasmic levels while hnRNP H/H' is undetectable, whereas both proteins are more evenly expressed in distal tubules and collecting ducts. Generally, tumor tissues reveal a broad expression of hnRNP F in the nuclei as well as in the cytoplasm while hnRNP H/H' is expressed at higher levels in the nuclei than in the cytoplasm. Up-regulation of hnRNP H/H' is found in a few tissues that normally express low cytoplasmic levels of hnRNP H/H', for example, adenocarcinoma of the pancreas, hepatocellular carcinoma and gastric carcinoma. hnRNP F is down-regulated in hepatocellular carcinoma and up-regulated in gastric carcinoma. The present study indicates the important potential role of this subset of hnRNPs on the gene expression in many tissues.},

PCBP1 inhibits the invasion of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells, but there are few studies on the specific regulatory target and mechanism of RBPs in HCC, and it is unclear whether PCBP1 plays a role in tumour metastasis as a splicing factor. We analysed the regulation of gene expression by PCBP1 at the transcriptional level. We obtained and analysed PCBP1-knockdown RNA-seq data and eCLIP-seq data of PCBP1 in HepG2 cells and found that PCBP1 widely regulates the alternative splicing and expression of genes enriched in cancer-related pathways, including extracellular matrix, cell adhesion, small molecule metabolic process and apoptosis. We validated five regulated alternative splicing events affected by PCBP1 using RT-qPCR and found that there was a significant difference in the expression of APOC1 and SPHK1 between tumour and normal tissues. In this study, we provided convincing evidence that human PCBP1 profoundly regulates the splicing of genes associated with tumour metastasis. These findings provide new insight into potential markers or therapeutic targets for HCC treatment.},

Aberrant targeting of these mechanisms is implicated in lymphomagenesis, but the mutational processes are poorly understood. By performing whole genome and transcriptome sequencing of 181 germinal center derived B-cell lymphomas (gcBCL) we identified distinct mutational signatures linked to SHM and CSR. We show that not only SHM, but presumably also CSR causes off-target mutations in non-IG genes. Kataegis clusters with high mutational density mainly affected early replicating regions and were enriched for SHM- and CSR-mediated off-target mutations. Moreover, they often co-occurred in loci physically interacting in the nucleus, suggesting that mutation hotspots promote increased mutation targeting of spatially co-localized loci (termed hypermutation by proxy). Only around 1\% of somatic small variants were in protein coding sequences, but in about half of the driver genes, a contribution of B-cell specific mutational processes to their mutations was found. The B-cell-specific mutational processes contribute to both lymphoma initiation and intratumoral heterogeneity. Overall, we demonstrate that mutational processes involved in the development of gcBCL are more complex than previously appreciated, and that B cell-specific mutational processes contribute via diverse mechanisms to lymphomagenesis.},

The CA repeat enhancer requires for its activity specific binding of hnRNP L. Here we show that in the absence of bound hnRNP L, the pre-mRNA is cleaved directly upstream of the CA repeats. The addition of recombinant hnRNP L restores RNA stability. CA repeats are both necessary and sufficient for this specific cleavage in the 5′ adjacent RNA sequence. We conclude that—in addition to its role as a splicing activator—hnRNP L can act in vitro as a sequence-specific RNA protection factor. Based on the wide abundance of CA repetitive sequences in the human genome, this may represent a novel, generally important role of this abundant hnRNP protein.},

As a result, we describe 11 target genes of hnRNP L that were validated by RT-PCR and that represent several new modes of hnRNP L-dependent splicing regulation, involving both activator and repressor functions: first, intron retention; second, inclusion or skipping of cassette-type exons; third, suppression of multiple exons; and fourth, alternative poly(A) site selection.

  abstract = {Analysis of imaging mass cytometry (IMC) data and other low-resolution multiplexed tissue imaging technologies is often confounded by poor single-cell segmentation and suboptimal approaches for data visualization and exploration. This can lead to inaccurate identification of cell phenotypes, states, or spatial relationships compared to reference data from single-cell suspension technologies. To this end we have developed the "OPTimized Imaging Mass cytometry AnaLysis (OPTIMAL)" framework to benchmark any approaches for cell segmentation, parameter transformation, batch effect correction, data visualization/clustering, and spatial neighborhood analysis. Using a panel of 27 metal-tagged antibodies recognizing well-characterized phenotypic and functional markers to stain the same Formalin-Fixed Paraffin Embedded (FFPE) human tonsil sample tissue microarray over 12 temporally distinct batches we tested several cell segmentation models, a range of different arcsinh cofactor parameter transformation values, 5 different dimensionality reduction algorithms, and 2 clustering methods. Finally, we assessed the optimal approach for performing neighborhood analysis. We found that single-cell segmentation was improved by the use of an Ilastik-derived probability map but that issues with poor segmentation were only really evident after clustering and cell type/state identification and not always evident when using "classical" bivariate data display techniques. The optimal arcsinh cofactor for parameter transformation was 1 as it maximized the statistical separation between negative and positive signal distributions and a simple Z-score normalization step after arcsinh transformation eliminated batch effects. Of the five different dimensionality reduction approaches tested, PacMap gave the best data structure with FLOWSOM clustering out-performing phenograph in terms of cell type identification. We also found that neighborhood analysis was influenced by the method used for finding neighboring cells with a "disc" pixel expansion outperforming a "bounding box" approach combined with the need for filtering objects based on size and image-edge location. Importantly, OPTIMAL can be used to assess and integrate with any existing approach to IMC data analysis and, as it creates .FCS files from the segmentation output and allows for single-cell exploration to be conducted using a wide variety of accessible software and algorithms familiar to conventional flow cytometrists.},

  abstract = {Increasing evidence has indicated that the splicing factor hnRNPA2B1 plays a direct role in cancer development, progression, gene expression, and signal transduction. Previous studies have shown that knocking down hnRNPA2B1 in breast cancer cells induces apoptosis, but the mechanism and other functions of hnRNPA2B1 in breast cancer are unknown. The goal of this study was to investigate the biological function, clinical significance, and mechanism of hnRNPA2B1 in breast cancer. The expression of hnRNPA2B1 in 92 breast cancer and adjacent normal tissue pairs was analyzed by immunohistochemical staining. Stable clones exhibiting knockdown of hnRNPA2B1 via small hairpin RNA expression were generated using RNA interference technology in breast cancer cell lines. The effects of hnRNPA2B1 on cell proliferation were examined by MTT and EdU assay, and cellular apoptosis and the cell cycle were examined by flow cytometry. A nude mouse xenograft model was established to elucidate the function of hnRNPA2B1 in tumorigenesis in vivo. The role of hnRNPA2B1 in signaling pathways was investigated in vitro. Our data revealed that hnRNPA2B1 was overexpressed in breast cancer tissue specimens and cell lines. Knockdown of hnRNPA2B1 reduced breast cancer cell proliferation, induced apoptosis, and prolonged the S phase of the cell cycle in vitro. In addition, hnRNPA2B1 knockdown suppressed subcutaneous tumorigenicity in vivo. On a molecular level, hnRNPA2B1 knockdown decreased signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 and extracellular-signal-regulated kinase 1/2 phosphorylation. We concluded that hnRNPA2B1 promotes the tumorigenic potential of breast cancer cells, MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231, through the extracellular-signal-regulated kinase 1/2 or signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 pathway, which may serve as a target for future therapies.},

  abstract = {Transcript-selective translational regulation of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) by transforming growth factor-β (TGFβ) is directed by the hnRNP E1-containing TGFβ-activated-translational (BAT) mRNP complex. Herein, eukaryotic elongation factor-1 A1 (eEF1A1) is identified as an integral component of the BAT complex. Translational silencing of Dab2 and ILEI, two EMT-transcripts, is mediated by binding of hnRNP E1 and eEF1A1 to their 3′-UTR BAT element, whereby hnRNP E1 stalls translational elongation by inhibiting the release of eEF1A1 from the ribosomal A site. TGFβ-mediated hnRNP E1 phosphorylation, through Akt2, disrupts the BAT complex, thereby restoring translation of target EMT-transcripts. Attenuation of hnRNP E1 expression in two non-invasive breast epithelial cells (NMuMG and MCF-7) induced not only EMT, but also enabled cells to form metastatic lesions in vivo. Thus, translational regulation by TGFβ, at the elongation stage, represents a critical checkpoint coordinating the expression of EMT-transcripts required during development and in tumorigenesis and metastatic progression.},

  abstract = {RNA interference (RNAi) is an ancient biological mechanism used to defend against external invasion. It theoretically can silence any disease-related genes in a sequence-specific manner, making small interfering RNA (siRNA) a promising therapeutic modality. After a two-decade journey from its discovery, two approvals of siRNA therapeutics, ONPATTRO® (patisiran) and GIVLAARI™ (givosiran), have been achieved by Alnylam Pharmaceuticals. Reviewing the long-term pharmaceutical history of human beings, siRNA therapy currently has set up an extraordinary milestone, as it has already changed and will continue to change the treatment and management of human diseases. It can be administered quarterly, even twice-yearly, to achieve therapeutic effects, which is not the case for small molecules and antibodies. The drug development process was extremely hard, aiming to surmount complex obstacles, such as how to efficiently and safely deliver siRNAs to desired tissues and cells and how to enhance the performance of siRNAs with respect to their activity, stability, specificity and potential off-target effects. In this review, the evolution of siRNA chemical modifications and their biomedical performance are comprehensively reviewed. All clinically explored and commercialized siRNA delivery platforms, including the GalNAc (N-acetylgalactosamine)–siRNA conjugate, and their fundamental design principles are thoroughly discussed. The latest progress in siRNA therapeutic development is also summarized. This review provides a comprehensive view and roadmap for general readers working in the field.},

We found a C-rich element (CRE) in mu-opioid receptor (MOR) 3'-untranslated region (UTR) to which poly (rC) binding protein 1 (PCBP1) binds, resulting in MOR mRNA stabilization. RNA immunoprecipitation and RNA EMSA revealed the formation of PCBP1-RNA complexes at the element. Knockdown of PCBP1 decreased MOR mRNA half-life and protein expression. Stimulation by forskolin increased cytoplasmic localization of PCBP1 and PCBP1/MOR 3'-UTR interactions via increased serine phosphorylation that was blocked by protein kinase A (PKA) or (phosphatidyl inositol-3) PI3-kinase inhibitors. The forskolin treatment also enhanced serine- and tyrosine-phosphorylation of AU-rich element binding protein (AUF1), concurrent with its increased binding to the CRE, and led to an increased interaction of poly A binding protein (PABP) with the CRE and poly(A) sites. AUF1 phosphorylation also led to an increased interaction with PCBP1. These findings suggest that a single co-regulator, PCBP1, plays a crucial role in stabilizing MOR mRNA, and is induced by PKA signaling by conforming to AUF1 and PABP.},

Using two extensive spike-in studies and a dilution study, we developed a set of tools for assessing the effectiveness of expression measures. We found that the performance of the current version of the default expression measure provided by Affymetrix Microarray Suite can be significantly improved by the use of probe level summaries derived from empirically motivated statistical models.

  abstract = {The binding of human PCBP1 protein to heavily oxidized RNA triggers the induction of apoptosis-related reactions, including the activation of caspase-3 and the cleavage of PARP-1. The introduction of amino acid substitutions in the PCBP1 abolishes this, resulting in the failure of PARP-1 cleavage. Human cells appear to possess a mechanism to induce cell death when their messenger RNAs are severely damaged. This mechanism might be related to the accumulation of abnormal proteins in long-lived cells, such as those in the nervous system., In aerobically growing cells, the guanine base of RNA is oxidized to 8-oxo-7,8-dihydroguanine (8-oxoG), which induces alteration in their gene expression. We previously demonstrated that the human AUF1 protein binds to 8-oxoG in RNA to induce the selective degradation of oxidized messenger RNA. We herein report that the poly(C)-binding protein PCBP1 binds to more severely oxidized RNA to activate apoptosis-related reactions. While AUF1 binds to oligoribonucleotides carrying a single 8-oxoG, PCBP1 does not bind to such oligoribonucleotides but instead binds firmly to oligoribonucleotides in which two 8-oxoG residues are located nearby. PCBP1-deficient cells, constructed from the human HeLa S3 line using the CRISPR-Cas9 system, exhibited higher survival rates than HeLa S3 cells when small doses of hydrogen peroxide were applied. The levels of caspase-3 activation and PARP-1 cleavage in the PCBP1-deficient cells were significantly lower than those in wild-type cells. The structure–function relationship of PCBP1 was established with the use of PCBP1 mutant proteins in which the conserved KH domains were defective. Human cells appear to possess two distinct mechanisms, one controlled by AUF1 and the other by PCBP1, with the former functioning when messenger RNA is moderately oxidized and the latter operating when the RNA is more severely damaged.},

Applying SigProfilerExtractor to 4,643 whole-genome- and 19,184 whole-exome-sequenced cancers reveals four novel signatures. Two of the signatures are confirmed in independent cohorts, and one of these signatures is associated with tobacco smoking.

  abstract = {The term “lymphoma” describes a heterogeneous group of disorders involving monoclonal proliferation of malignant lymphocytes. As a group, lymphomas are among the most common tumors of dogs. Yet our enumeration and understanding of the many subtypes of lymphoma have been relatively slow, perhaps in part because for many years lymphoma was treated as a singular entity rather than a group of distinct diseases. The recognition that the full spectrum of lymphoid malignancies seen in humans also occurs in dogs, and that these tumors retain not only morphologic similarities and biological behavior but also synonymous driver molecular abnormalities, sets an ideal stage for dual-purpose research that can accelerate progress for these diseases in both species. Specifically, dogs represent exceptional models for defining causality, understanding progression, and developing new treatments for lymphoma in comparatively brief windows of time. Unique advantages of canine models include (1) spontaneous disease occurring without an isogenic background or genetic engineering; (2) chronology of disease adapted to lifespan, (3) shared environment and societal status that allows dogs to be treated as “patients,” while at the same time being able to ethically explore translational innovations that are not possible in human subjects; and (4) organization of dogs into breeds with relatively homogeneous genetic backgrounds and distinct predisposition for lymphomas. Here, we will review recent studies describing intrinsic and extrinsic factors that contribute to the pathogenesis of canine and human lymphomas, as well as newly developed tools that will enhance the fidelity of these models to improve diagnosis and develop new treatments.},

  abstract = {Splenic diffuse red pulp lymphoma is an indolent small B-cell lymphoma recognized as a provisional entity in the World Health Organization 2008 classification. Its precise relationship to other related splenic B-cell lymphomas with frequent leukemic involvement or other lymphoproliferative disorders remains undetermined. We performed whole-exome sequencing to explore the genetic landscape of ten cases of splenic diffuse red pulp lymphoma using paired tumor and normal samples. A selection of 109 somatic mutations was then evaluated in a cohort including 42 samples of splenic diffuse red pulp lymphoma and compared to those identified in 46 samples of splenic marginal zone lymphoma and eight samples of hairy-cell leukemia. Recurrent mutations or losses in BCOR (the gene encoding the BCL6 corepressor) - frameshift (n=3), nonsense (n=2), splicing site (n=1), and copy number loss (n=4) - were identified in 10/42 samples of splenic diffuse red pulp lymphoma (24\%), whereas only one frameshift mutation was identified in 46 cases of splenic marginal zone lymphoma (2\%). Inversely, KLF2, TNFAIP3 and MYD88, common mutations in splenic marginal zone lymphoma, were rare (one KLF2 mutant in 42 samples; 2\%) or absent (TNFAIP3 and MYD88) in splenic diffuse red pulp lymphoma. These findings define an original genetic profile of splenic diffuse red pulp lymphoma and suggest that the mechanisms of pathogenesis of this lymphoma are distinct from those of splenic marginal zone lymphoma and hairy-cell leukemia.},

  abstract = {Primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma (PMBL) is an entity of B-cell lymphoma distinct from the other molecular subtypes of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). We investigated the prevalence, specificity, and clinical relevance of mutations of XPO1, which encodes a member of the karyopherin-β nuclear transporters, in a large cohort of PMBL. PMBL cases defined histologically or by gene expression profiling (GEP) were sequenced and the XPO1 mutational status was correlated to genetic and clinical characteristics. The XPO1 mutational status was also assessed in DLBCL, Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) and mediastinal gray-zone lymphoma (MGZL).The biological impact of the mutation on Selective Inhibitor of Nuclear Export (SINE) compounds (KPT-185/330) sensitivity was investigated in vitro. XPO1 mutations were present in 28/117 (24\%) PMBL cases and in 5/19 (26\%) HL cases but absent/rare in MGZL (0/20) or DLBCL (3/197). A higher prevalence (50\%) of the recurrent codon 571 variant (p.E571K) was observed in GEP-defined PMBL and was associated with shorter PFS. Age, International Prognostic Index and bulky mass were similar in XPO1 mutant and wild-type cases. KPT-185 induced a dose-dependent decrease in cell proliferation and increased cell-death in PMBL cell lines harboring wild type or XPO1 E571K mutant alleles. Experiments in transfected U2OS cells further confirmed that the XPO1 E571K mutation does not have a drastic impact on KPT-330 binding. To conclude the XPO1 E571K mutation represents a genetic hallmark of the PMBL subtype and serves as a new relevant PMBL biomarker. SINE compounds appear active for both mutated and wild-type protein.

  abstract = {Eukaryotic cells express a large variety of RNA binding proteins (RBPs), with diverse affinities and specificities towards target RNAs. These proteins play a crucial role in almost every aspect of RNA biogenesis, expression and function. The heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs) are a complex and diverse family of RNA binding proteins. hnRNPs display multiple functions in the processing of heterogeneous nuclear RNAs into mature messenger RNAs. hnRNP A1 is one of the most abundant and ubiquitously expressed members of this protein family. hnRNP A1 plays multiple roles in gene expression by regulating major steps in the processing of nascent RNA transcripts. The transcription, splicing, stability, export through nuclear pores and translation of cellular and viral transcripts are all mechanisms modulated by this protein. The diverse functions played by hnRNP A1 are not limited to mRNA biogenesis, but extend to the processing of microRNAs, telomere maintenance and the regulation of transcription factor activity. Genomic approaches have recently uncovered the extent of hnRNP A1 roles in the development and differentiation of living organisms. The aim of this review is to highlight recent developments in the study of this protein and to describe its functions in cellular and viral gene expression and its role in human pathologies.},

CellChat predicts major signaling inputs and outputs for cells and how those cells and signals coordinate for functions using network analysis and pattern recognition approaches. Through manifold learning and quantitative contrasts, CellChat classifies signaling pathways and delineates conserved and context-specific pathways across different datasets. Applying CellChat to mouse and human skin datasets shows its ability to extract complex signaling patterns. Our versatile and easy-to-use toolkit CellChat and a web-based Explorer ( http://www.cellchat.org/ ) will help discover novel intercellular communications and build cell-cell communication atlases in diverse tissues.},

The resulting deregulation of c-myc expression is a critical step in tumorigenesis. The translocation breakpoint may lie within c-myc proper, in which case deregulation is due, in part, to dissociation of key 5' regulatory sequences from the protein-coding portions of the gene. Alternatively, the breakpoint may flank c-myc, leaving the gene grossly intact. In these latter cases, mutation, which may be extensive, is usually seen within c-myc, specifically at or near the same key regulatory sequences. The precise contribution of these mutations to c-myc deregulation is gradually being clarified. The mechanisms underlying c-myc mutations are not known. Hypermutation in c-myc may reflect the influence of the juxtaposed immunoglobulin gene, which is subject to hypermutation during an intermediate stage of normal B lymphoid development. This relationship, however, has not been firmly established.},

  abstract = {SRp20 is a member of the highly conserved SR family of splicing regulators. Using a variety of reporter gene constructs, we show that SRp20 regulates alternative splicing of its own mRNA. Overexpression of SRp20 results in a reduction in the level of exon 4-skipped SRp20 transcripts and activates the production of transcripts containing exon 4. These exon 4-included transcripts encode a truncated protein lacking the C-terminal RS domain. We provide evidence that SRp20 probably enhances the recognition of the otherwise unused, weak splice acceptor of exon 4. The recognition of exons with weak splice acceptor sites may be a general activity of SRp20. Unexpectedly, ASF/SF2, another member of the SR family, antagonizes the effect of SRp20 on SRp20 pre-mRNA splicing and suppresses the production of the exon 4-included form. Our results indicate that ASF/SF2 suppresses the use of the alternative exon 4, most likely by inhibiting the recognition of the splice donor of exon 4. These results demonstrate, for the first time, an auto-regulatory activity of an SR protein which is antagonized by a second SR protein.},

Significant differences between lFL and sFL, however, were detected for SCNA frequencies, e.g., in 18q-gains (14\% lFL vs. 36\% sFL; p\,=\,0.0003). Although rare in lFL, gains in 18q21 were associated with inferior progression-free survival (PFS). The mutational landscape of lFL and sFL included typical genetic lesions.

However, predicted loss-of-function (pLoF) variants are enriched for annotation errors, and tend to be found at extremely low frequencies, so their analysis requires careful variant annotation and very large sample sizes. Here, we describe the aggregation of 125,748 exomes and 15,708 genomes from human sequencing studies into the Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD). We identify 443,769 high-confidence pLoF variants in this cohort after filtering for sequencing and annotation artifacts.

  abstract = {Chromosomal instability (CIN) and somatic copy-number alterations (SCNA) play a key role in the evolutionary process that shapes cancer genomes. SC-NAs comprise many classes of clinically relevant events, such as localised amplifications, gains, losses, loss-of-heterozygosity (LOH) events, and recently discovered parallel evolutionary events revealed by multi-sample phasing. These events frequently appear jointly with whole genome doubling (WGD), a transformative event in tumour evolution involving tetraploidization of genomes preceded or followed by individual chromosomal copy-number changes and associated with an overall increase in structural CIN. While SCNAs have been leveraged for phylogeny reconstruction in the past, existing methods do not take WGD events into account and cannot model parallel evolution. They frequently make use of the infinite sites assumption, do not model horizontal dependencies between adjacent genomic loci and can not infer ancestral genomes. Here we present MEDICC2, a new phylogeny inference algorithm for allele-specific SCNA data that addresses these shortcomings. MEDICC2 dispenses with the infinite sites assumption, models parallel evolution and accurately identifies clonal and subclonal WGD events. It times SCNAs relative to each other, quantifies SCNA burden in single-sample studies and infers phylogenetic trees and ancestral genomes in multi-sample or single-cell sequencing scenarios with thousands of cells. We demonstrate MEDICC2’s ability on simulated data, real-world data of 2,778 single sample tumours from the Pan-cancer analysis of whole genomes (PCAWG), 10 bulk multi-region prostate cancer patients and two recent single-cell datasets of triple-negative breast cancer comprising several thousands of single cells.},

  abstract = {Endemic Burkitt lymphoma (eBL) is the most common pediatric cancer in malaria-endemic equatorial Africa and nearly always contains Epstein–Barr virus (EBV), unlike sporadic Burkitt lymphoma (sBL) that occurs with a lower incidence in developed countries. Given these differences and the variable clinical presentation and outcomes, we sought to further understand pathogenesis by investigating transcriptomes using RNA sequencing (RNAseq) from multiple primary eBL tumors compared with sBL tumors. Within eBL tumors, minimal expression differences were found based on: anatomical presentation site, in-hospital survival rates, and EBV genome type, suggesting that eBL tumors are homogeneous without marked subtypes. The outstanding difference detected using surrogate variable analysis was the significantly decreased expression of key genes in the immunoproteasome complex (PSMB9/β1i, PSMB10/β2i, PSMB8/β5i, and PSME2/PA28β) in eBL tumors carrying type 2 EBV compared with type 1 EBV. Second, in comparison with previously published pediatric sBL specimens, the majority of the expression and pathway differences was related to the PTEN/PI3K/mTOR signaling pathway and was correlated most strongly with EBV status rather than geographic designation. Third, common mutations were observed significantly less frequently in eBL tumors harboring EBV type 1, with mutation frequencies similar between tumors with EBV type 2 and without EBV. In addition to the previously reported genes, a set of new genes mutated in BL, including TFAP4, MSH6, PRRC2C, BCL7A, FOXO1, PLCG2, PRKDC, RAD50, and RPRD2, were identified. Overall, these data establish that EBV, particularly EBV type 1, supports BL oncogenesis, alleviating the need for certain driver mutations in the human genome.Implications: Genomic and mutational analyses of Burkitt lymphoma tumors identify key differences based on viral content and clinical outcomes suggesting new avenues for the development of prognostic molecular biomarkers and therapeutic interventions.

Any disruption in APP protein production, its mRNA decay rate or processing may result in abnormal production of amyloid-β peptides and subsequent development of protein aggregation diseases. Therefore, the equilibrium is crucial for neuronal function. An association study of heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP)-F and hnRNP H1 with APP was carried out in Neuro-2a (N2a) cells. In the present study, we found that hnRNP F and hnRNP H1 were significantly upregulated in the hippocampus of APP/PS1 mice. The changes in APP expression were positively associated with hnRNP F and hnRNP H1 when hnRNP F and hnRNP H1 were depleted or increased in N2a cells. Importantly, cross-linked RNA immunoprecipitation demonstrated binding affinities of hnRNP F and hnRNP H1 for App mRNA. Mechanistically, mRNA stability assay revealed that overexpression of hnRNP F or hnRNP H1 increases the APP level by stabilizing App mRNA half-life, implying that levels of hnRNP F and hnRNP H1 can change the production of APP. Further understanding of the regulatory mechanism of APP expression in association with hnRNP F and hnRNP H1 would provide insights into the mechanism underlying the maintenance of brain health and cognition. This study provides a theoretical basis for the development of hnRNP-stabilizing compounds to regulate APP.},

  abstract = {Guanine-quadruplexes (G4s) are non-canonical four-stranded structures that can be formed in guanine (G) rich nucleic acid sequences. A great number of G-rich sequences capable of forming G4 structures have been described based on in vitro analysis, and evidence supporting their formation in live cells continues to accumulate. While formation of DNA G4s (dG4s) within chromatin in vivo has been supported by different chemical, imaging and genomic approaches, formation of RNA G4s (rG4s) in vivo remains a matter of discussion. Recent data support the dynamic nature of G4 formation in the transcriptome. Such dynamic fluctuation of rG4 folding-unfolding underpins the biological significance of these structures in the regulation of RNA metabolism. Moreover, rG4-mediated functions may ultimately be connected to mechanisms underlying disease pathologies and, potentially, provide novel options for therapeutics. In this framework, we will review the landscape of rG4s within the transcriptome, focus on their potential impact on biological processes, and consider an emerging connection of these functions in human health and disease.}

  abstract = {Somatic hypermutation (SHM) in the variable region of immunoglobulin genes (IGV) naturally occurs in a narrow window of B cell development to provide high-affinity antibodies. However, SHM can also aberrantly target proto-oncogenes and cause genome instability. The role of aberrant SHM (aSHM) has been widely studied in various non-Hodgkin's lymphoma particularly in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Although, it has been speculated that aSHM targets a wide range of genome loci so far only twelve genes have been identified as targets of aSHM through the targeted sequencing of selected genes. A genome-wide study aiming at identifying a comprehensive set of aSHM targets recurrently occurring in DLBCL has not been previously undertaken. Here, we present a comprehensive assessment of the somatic hypermutated genes in DLBCL identified through an analysis of genomic and transcriptome data derived from 40 DLBCL patients. Our analysis verifies that there are indeed many genes that are recurrently affected by aSHM. In particular, we have identified 32 novel targets that show same or higher level of aSHM activity than genes previously reported. Amongst these novel targets, 22 genes showed a significant correlation between mRNA abundance and aSHM.},

  abstract = {Daily mRNA oscillations of circadian clock genes largely depend on transcriptional regulation. However, several lines of evidence highlight the critical role of post-transcriptional regulation in the oscillations of circadian mRNA oscillations. Clearly, variations in the mRNA decay rate lead to changes in the cycling profiles. However, the mechanisms controlling the mRNA stability of clock genes are not fully understood. Here we demonstrate that the turnover rate of mouse Period3 (m Per3 ) mRNA is dramatically changed in a circadian phase-dependent manner. Furthermore, the circadian regulation of m Per3 mRNA stability requires the cooperative function of 5′- and 3′-untranslated regions (UTRs). Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein Q (hnRNP Q) binds to both 5′- and 3′-UTR and triggers enhancement of translation and acceleration of mRNA decay. We propose the phase-dependent translation coupled mRNA decay mediated by hnRNP Q as a new regulatory mechanism of the rhythmically regulated decay of m Per3 mRNA.}

  abstract = {Abstract The human nonsense-mediated mRNA decay pathway (NMD) performs quality control and regulatory functions within complex post-transcriptional regulatory networks. In addition to degradation-promoting factors, efficient and accurate detection of NMD substrates involves proteins that safeguard normal mRNAs. Here, we identify hnRNP L as a factor that protects mRNAs with NMD-inducing features including long 3?UTRs. Using biochemical and transcriptome-wide approaches, we provide evidence that the susceptibility of a given transcript to NMD can be modulated by its 3?UTR length and ability to recruit hnRNP L. Integrating these findings with the previously defined role of polypyrimidine tract binding protein 1 in NMD evasion enables enhanced prediction of transcript susceptibility to NMD. Unexpectedly, this system is subverted in B cell lymphomas harboring translocations that produce BCL2:IGH fusion mRNAs. CRISPR/Cas9 deletion of hnRNP L binding sites near the BCL2 stop codon reduces expression of the fusion mRNAs and induces apoptosis. Together, our data indicate that protection by hnRNP L overrides the presence of multiple 3?UTR introns, allowing these aberrant mRNAs to evade NMD and promoting BCL2 overexpression and neoplasia.},

  abstract = {Mutations within the catalytic domain of the histone methyltransferase EZH2 have been identified in subsets of patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). These genetic alterations are hypothesized to confer an oncogenic dependency on EZH2 enzymatic activity in these cancers. We have previously reported the discovery of EPZ005678 and EPZ-6438, potent and selective S-adenosyl-methionine-competitive small molecule inhibitors of EZH2. Although both compounds are similar with respect to their mechanism of action and selectivity, EPZ-6438 possesses superior potency and drug-like properties, including good oral bioavailability in animals. Here, we characterize the activity of EPZ-6438 in preclinical models of NHL. EPZ-6438 selectively inhibits intracellular lysine 27 of histone H3 (H3K27) methylation in a concentration- and time-dependent manner in both EZH2 wild-type and mutant lymphoma cells. Inhibition of H3K27 trimethylation (H3K27Me3) leads to selective cell killing of human lymphoma cell lines bearing EZH2 catalytic domain point mutations. Treatment of EZH2-mutant NHL xenograft-bearing mice with EPZ-6438 causes dose-dependent tumor growth inhibition, including complete and sustained tumor regressions with correlative diminution of H3K27Me3 levels in tumors and selected normal tissues. Mice dosed orally with EPZ-6438 for 28 days remained tumor free for up to 63 days after stopping compound treatment in two EZH2-mutant xenograft models. These data confirm the dependency of EZH2-mutant NHL on EZH2 activity and portend the utility of EPZ-6438 as a potential treatment for these genetically defined cancers.

  abstract = {Adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATL) is an aggressive neoplasm immunophenotypically resembling regulatory T cells, associated with human T-cell leukemia virus type-1. Here, we performed whole-genome sequencing (WGS) of 150 ATL cases to reveal the overarching landscape of genetic alterations in ATL. We discovered frequent (33\%) loss-of-function alterations preferentially targeting the CIC long isoform, which were overlooked by previous exome-centric studies of various cancer types. Long but not short isoform-specific inactivation of Cic selectively increased CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ T cells in~vivo. We also found recurrent (13\%) 3'-truncations of REL, which induce transcriptional upregulation and generate gain-of-function proteins. More importantly, REL truncations are also common in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, especially in germinal center B-cell-like subtype (12\%). In the non-coding genome, we identified recurrent mutations in regulatory elements, particularly splice sites, of several driver genes. In addition, we characterized the different mutational processes operative in clustered hypermutation sites within and outside immunoglobulin/T-cell receptor genes and identified the mutational enrichment at the binding sites of host and viral transcription factors, suggesting their activities in ATL. By combining the analyses for coding and noncoding mutations, structural variations, and copy number alterations, we discovered 56 recurrently altered driver genes, including 11 novel ones. Finally, ATL cases were classified into 2 molecular groups with distinct clinical and genetic characteristics based on the driver alteration profile. Our findings not only help to improve diagnostic and therapeutic strategies in ATL, but also provide insights into T-cell biology and have implications for genome-wide cancer driver discovery.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Approximately 20\% of patients with stage II colorectal cancer will experience a relapse. Current clinical-pathologic stratification factors do not allow clear identification of these high-risk patients. ColoPrint (Agendia, Amsterdam, The Netherlands, http://www.agendia.com) is a gene expression classifier that distinguishes patients with low or high risk of disease relapse. METHODS: ColoPrint was developed using whole-genome expression data and validated in several independent validation cohorts. Stage II patients from these studies were pooled (n = 416), and ColoPrint was compared with clinical risk factors described in the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) 2013 Guidelines for Colon Cancer. Median follow-up was 81 months. Most patients (70\%) did not receive adjuvant chemotherapy. Risk of relapse (ROR) was defined as survival until first event of recurrence or death from cancer. RESULTS: In the pooled stage II data set, ColoPrint identified 63\% of patients as low risk with a 5-year ROR of 10\%, whereas high-risk patients (37\%) had a 5-year ROR of 21\%, with a hazard ratio (HR) of 2.16 (p = .004). This remained significant in a multivariate model that included number of lymph nodes retrieved and microsatellite instability. In the T3 microsatellite-stable subgroup (n = 301), ColoPrint classified 59\% of patients as low risk with a 5-year ROR of 9.9\%. High-risk patients (31\%) had a 22.4\% ROR (HR: 2.41; p = .005). In contrast, the NCCN clinical high-risk factors were unable to distinguish high- and low-risk patients (15\% vs. 13\% ROR; p = .55). CONCLUSION: ColoPrint significantly improved prognostic accuracy independent of microsatellite status or clinical variables, facilitating the identification of patients at higher risk who might be considered for additional treatment.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Follicular lymphoma (FL) is an indolent, yet incurable B cell malignancy. A subset of patients experience an increased mortality rate driven by two distinct clinical end points: histological transformation and early progression after immunochemotherapy. The nature of tumor clonal dynamics leading to these clinical end points is poorly understood, and previously determined genetic alterations do not explain the majority of transformed cases or accurately predict early progressive disease. We contend that detailed knowledge of the expansion patterns of specific cell populations plus their associated mutations would provide insight into therapeutic strategies and disease biology over the time course of FL clinical histories. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Using a combination of whole genome sequencing, targeted deep sequencing, and digital droplet PCR on matched diagnostic and relapse specimens, we deciphered the constituent clonal populations in 15 transformation cases and 6 progression cases, and measured the change in clonal population abundance over time. We observed widely divergent patterns of clonal dynamics in transformed cases relative to progressed cases. Transformation specimens were generally composed of clones that were rare or absent in diagnostic specimens, consistent with dramatic clonal expansions that came to dominate the transformation specimens. This pattern was independent of time to transformation and treatment modality. By contrast, early progression specimens were composed of clones that were already present in the diagnostic specimens and exhibited only moderate clonal dynamics, even in the presence of immunochemotherapy. Analysis of somatic mutations impacting 94 genes was undertaken in an extension cohort consisting of 395 samples from 277 patients in order to decipher disrupted biology in the two clinical end points. We found 12 genes that were more commonly mutated in transformed samples than in the preceding FL tumors, including TP53, B2M, CCND3, GNA13, S1PR2, and P2RY8. Moreover, ten genes were more commonly mutated in diagnostic specimens of patients with early progression, including TP53, BTG1, MKI67, and XBP1. CONCLUSIONS: Our results illuminate contrasting modes of evolution shaping the clinical histories of transformation and progression. They have implications for interpretation of evolutionary dynamics in the context of treatment-induced selective pressures, and indicate that transformation and progression will require different clinical management strategies.},

Our current knowledge of this disease encompasses frequent secondary cytogenetic aberrations and the recurrent mutation of a handful of genes, such as TP53, ATM, and CCND1. However, these findings insufficiently explain the biologic underpinnings of MCL. Here, we performed whole transcriptome sequencing on a discovery cohort of 18 primary tissue MCL samples and 2 cell lines. We found recurrent mutations in NOTCH1, a finding that we confirmed in an extension cohort of 108 clinical samples and 8 cell lines. In total, 12\% of clinical samples and 20\% of cell lines harbored somatic NOTCH1 coding sequence mutations that clustered in the PEST domain and predominantly consisted of truncating mutations or small frame-shifting indels. NOTCH1 mutations were associated with poor overall survival (P = .003). Furthermore, we showed that inhibition of the NOTCH pathway reduced proliferation and induced apoptosis in 2 MCL cell lines. In summary, we have identified recurrent NOTCH1 mutations that provide the preclinical rationale for therapeutic inhibition of the NOTCH pathway in a subset of patients with MCL.},

  abstract = {Follicular lymphoma (FL) is the most common form of indolent non-Hodgkin lymphoma, yet it remains only partially characterized at the genomic level. To improve our understanding of the genetic underpinnings of this incurable and clinically heterogeneous disease, whole-exome sequencing was performed on tumor/normal pairs from a discovery cohort of 24 patients with FL. Using these data and mutations identified in other B-cell malignancies, 1716 genes were sequenced in 113 FL tumor samples from 105 primarily treatment-naive individuals. We identified 39 genes that were mutated significantly above background mutation rates. CREBBP mutations were associated with inferior PFS. In contrast, mutations in previously unreported HVCN1, a voltage-gated proton channel-encoding gene and B-cell receptor signaling modulator, were associated with improved PFS. In total, 47 (44.8\%) patients harbor mutations in the interconnected B-cell receptor (BCR) and CXCR4 signaling pathways. Histone gene mutations were more frequent than previously reported (identified in 43.8\% of patients) and often co-occurred (17.1\% of patients). A novel, recurrent hotspot was identified at a posttranslationally modified residue in the histone H2B family. This study expands the number of mutated genes described in several known signaling pathways and complexes involved in lymphoma pathogenesis (BCR, Notch, SWitch/sucrose nonfermentable (SWI/SNF), vacuolar ATPases) and identified novel recurrent mutations (EGR1/2, POU2AF1, BTK, ZNF608, HVCN1) that require further investigation in the context of FL biology, prognosis, and treatment.},

  abstract = {Introduction: Despite substantial recent advances, there is still an unmet need for better therapies in B-cell non Hodgkin lymphomas (B-NHL), especially in relapsed or refractory disease. Many novel targeted drugs have been developed based on a better molecular understanding of B-NHL. Areas covered: This article focuses on chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) as a representative for indolent lymphomas and paradigmatic for the tremendous progress in treating B-NHL on the one hand and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) as a representative for aggressive lymphomas and paradigmatic for many unsolved problems in lymphoma treatment or the other hand. We highlight salient points in current therapies targeting genetic, epigenetic, immunological and microenvironmental alterations. Possible reasons for drug failure in clinical trials like tumor heterogeneity, clonal evolution and drug resistance mechanisms are discussed. Based thereon, some perspectives for further drug discovery are given. Expert opinion: In view of the pathogenetic complexity of lymphomas, therapies targeting exclusively a single alteration may fail because resistance mechanisms are present either initially or evolve during treatment. Therefore, future therapies in B-NHL may have to target the greatest possible number of genetic, immunological or epigenetic alterations still allowing tolerability and to monitor these alterations during therapy.}

Using affinity chromatography on fractionated HeLa cells, we found that hnRNP U binds actin through a short amino acid sequence in its C-terminal domain. Post-transcriptional gene silencing of hnRNP U and nuclear microinjections of a short peptide encompassing the hnRNP U actin-binding sequence inhibited BrUTP incorporation in vivo. In living cells, we found that both actin and hnRNP U are associated with the phosphorylated C-terminal domain of Pol II, and antibodies to actin and hnRNP U blocked Pol II–mediated transcription. Taken together, our results indicate that a general actin-based mechanism is implicated in the transcription of most Pol II genes. Actin in complex with hnRNP U may carry out its regulatory role during the initial phases of transcription activation.},

  abstract = {Genomic variation in the untranslated region (UTR) has been shown to influence HLA class I expression level and associate with disease outcomes. Sequencing of the 3'UTR of common HLA-A alleles indicated the presence of two polyadenylation signals (PAS). The proximal PAS is conserved, whereas the distal PAS is disrupted within certain alleles by sequence variants. Using 3'RACE, we confirmed expression of two distinct forms of the HLA-A 3'UTR based on use of either the proximal or the distal PAS, which differ in length by 100 bp. Specific HLA-A alleles varied in the usage of the proximal versus distal PAS, with some alleles using only the proximal PAS, and others using both the proximal and distal PAS to differing degrees. We show that the short and the long 3'UTR produced similar mRNA expression levels. However, the long 3'UTR conferred lower luciferase activity as compared with the short form, indicating translation inhibition of the long 3'UTR. RNA affinity pull-down followed by mass spectrometry analysis as well as RNA coimmunoprecipitation indicated differential binding of Syncrip to the long versus short 3'UTR. Depletion of Syncrip by small interfering RNA increased surface expression of an HLA-A allotype that uses primarily the long 3'UTR, whereas an allotype expressing only the short form was unaffected. Furthermore, specific blocking of the proximal 3'UTR reduced surface expression without decreasing mRNA expression. These data demonstrate HLA-A allele-specific variation in PAS usage, which modulates their cell surface expression posttranscriptionally.},

The diagnosis of multiple myeloma is made when clear end-organ damage attributable to the plasma cell proliferative disorder or when findings that suggest a high likelihood of their development are present. Distinguishing symptomatic multiple myeloma that requires treatment from the precursor stages of monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance and smouldering multiple myeloma is important, as observation is the standard for those conditions. Much progress has been made over the past decade in the understanding of disease biology and individualized treatment approaches. Several new classes of drugs, such as proteasome inhibitors and immunomodulatory drugs, have joined the traditional armamentarium (corticosteroids, alkylating agents and anthracyclines) and, along with high-dose therapy and autologous haemopoietic stem cell transplantation, have led to deeper and durable clinical responses. Indeed, an increasing proportion of patients are achieving lasting remissions, raising the possibility of cure for this disease. Success will probably depend on using combinations of effective agents and treating patients in the early stages of disease, such as patients with smouldering multiple myeloma.},

Our previous miRNA profiling of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) revealed a mutation in the seed sequence of miR-142-3p. Further analysis now showed that miR-142 was mutated in 11 (19.64\%) of the 56 DLBCL cases. Of these, one case had a mutation in both alleles, with the remainder being heterozygous. Four mutations were found in the mature miR-142-5p, four in the mature miR-142-3p, and three mutations affected the miR-142 precursor. Two mutations in the seed sequence redirected miR-142-3p to the mRNA of the transcriptional repressor ZEB2 and one of them also targeted the ZEB1 mRNA. However, the other mutations in the mature miR-142-3p did not influence either the ZEB1 or ZEB2 3' untranslated region (3' UTR). On the other hand, the mutations affecting the seed sequence of miR-142-3p resulted in a loss of responsiveness in the 3' UTR of the known miR-142-3p targets RAC1 and ADCY9. In contrast to the mouse p300 gene, the human p300 gene was not found to be a target for miR-142-5p. In one case with a mutation of the precursor, we observed aberrant processing of the miR-142-5p. Our data suggest that the mutations in miR-142 probably lead to a loss rather than a gain of function. This is the first report describing mutations of a miRNA gene in a large percentage of a distinct lymphoma subtype.},

  abstract = {Protein synthesis is the most energy-consuming process in a proliferating cell, and understanding what controls protein abundances represents a key question in biology and biotechnology. We quantified absolute abundances of 5,354 mRNAs and 2,198 proteins in Saccharomyces cerevisiae under ten environmental conditions and protein turnover for 1,384 proteins under a reference condition. The overall correlation between mRNA and protein abundances across all conditions was low (0.46), but for differentially expressed proteins (n~= 202), the median mRNA-protein correlation was 0.88. We used these data to model translation efficiencies and found that they vary more than 400-fold between genes. Non-linear regression analysis detected that mRNA abundance and translation elongation were the dominant factors controlling protein synthesis, explaining 61\% and 15\% of its variance. Metabolic flux balance analysis further showed that only mitochondrial fluxes were positively associated with changes at the transcript level. The present dataset represents a crucial expansion to the current resources for future studies on yeast physiology.},

In Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-associated cases of cHL, expression of viral antigens most probably leads to NF-kappaB activation but for non-EBV-associated cases, the mechanism is not clear. Previous small studies have demonstrated deleterious mutations of NFKBIA, the gene encoding IkappaB alpha, in HRS cells. In the present study, we aimed to establish the frequency of NFKBIA mutation in cHL by investigating a larger series of cases and to determine whether these mutations are a characteristic feature of non-EBV-associated cHL. Single HRS cells from 20 cases of cHL were analysed by PCRs covering all 6 exons of the gene. Clonal deleterious mutations were detected in 3 cases and in 1 case both alleles of the gene were shown to harbour mutations. NFKBIA mutations were detected only in non-EBV-associated cases but the majority of these cases had wild-type NFKBIA. It remains possible that defects in genes encoding other inhibitors of NF-kappaB, such as TNFAIP3 (A20) and CYLD, are involved in the latter cases, as described for one case in this series.},

  abstract = {The random V(D)J recombination process ensures the diversity of the primary immunoglobulin (Ig) repertoire. In two thirds of cases, imprecise recombination between variable (V), diversity (D), and joining (J) segments induces a frameshift in the open reading frame that leads to the appearance of premature termination codons (PTCs). Thus, many B lineage cells harbour biallelic V(D)J-rearrangements of Ig heavy or light chain genes, with a productively-recombined allele encoding the functional Ig chain and a nonproductive allele potentially encoding truncated Ig polypeptides. Since the pattern of Ig gene expression is mostly biallelic, transcription initiated from nonproductive Ig alleles generates considerable amounts of primary transcripts with out-of-frame V(D)J junctions. How RNA surveillance pathways cooperate to control the noise from nonproductive Ig genes will be discussed in this review, focusing on the benefits of nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) activation during B-cell development and detrimental effects of nonsense-associated altered splicing (NAS) in terminally differentiated plasma cells.},

To explore the feasibility of creating a comprehensive catalogue of cancer genes, we analysed somatic point mutations in exome sequences from 4,742 human cancers and their matched normal-tissue samples across 21 cancer types. We found that large-scale genomic analysis can identify nearly all known cancer genes in these tumour types. Our analysis also identified 33 genes that were not previously known to be significantly mutated in cancer, including genes related to proliferation, apoptosis, genome stability, chromatin regulation, immune evasion, RNA processing and protein homeostasis. Down-sampling analysis indicates that larger sample sizes will reveal many more genes mutated at clinically important frequencies. We estimate that near-saturation may be achieved with 600-5,000 samples per tumour type, depending on background mutation frequency. The results may help to guide the next stage of cancer genomics.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Significant racial differences have been observed in the incidence and clinical outcomes of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) in the United States, but to the authors' knowledge it remains unclear whether genomic differences contribute to these disparities. METHODS: To understand the influences of genetic ancestry on tumor genomic alterations, the authors estimated the genetic ancestry of 1001 previously described patients with DLBCL using unsupervised model-based Admixture global ancestry analysis applied to exome sequencing data and examined the mutational profile of 150 DLBCL driver genes in tumors obtained from this cohort. RESULTS: Global ancestry prediction identified 619 patients with {$>$}90\% European ancestry, 81 patients with {$>$}90\% African ancestry, and 50 patients with {$>$}90\% Asian ancestry. Compared with patients with DLBCL with European ancestry, patients with African ancestry were aged {$>$}10~years younger at the time of diagnosis and were more likely to present with B symptoms, elevated serum lactate dehydrogenase, extranodal disease, and advanced stage disease. Patients with African ancestry demonstrated worse overall survival compared with patients with European ancestry (median, 4.9~years vs 8.8~years; P~=~.04). Recurrent mutations of MLL2 (KMT2D), HIST1H1E, MYD88, BCL2, and PIM1 were found across all ancestry groups, suggesting shared mechanisms underlying tumor biology. The authors also identified 6 DLBCL driver genes that were more commonly mutated in patients with African ancestry compared with patients with European ancestry: ATM (21.0\% vs 7.75\%; P~{$<~$}.001), MGA (19.7\% vs 5.33\%; P~{$<~$}.001), SETD2 (17.3\% vs 5.17\%; P~{$<~$}.001), TET2 (12.3\% vs 5.82\%; P~=~.029), MLL3 (KMT2C) (11.1\% vs 4.36\%; P~=~.013), and DNMT3A (11.1\% vs 4.52\%; P~=~.016). CONCLUSIONS: Distinct prevalence and patterns of mutation highlight an important difference in the mutational landscapes of DLBCL arising in different ancestry groups. To the authors' knowledge, the results of the current study provide the first-ever characterization of genetic alterations among patients with African descent who are diagnosed with DLBCL.},

  abstract = {In tumours, aberrant splicing generates variants that contribute to multiple aspects of tumour establishment, progression and maintenance. We show that in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) specimens, death-domain adaptor protein Insuloma-Glucagonoma protein 20 (IG20) is consistently aberrantly spliced to generate an antagonist, anti-apoptotic isoform (MAP-kinase activating death domain protein, MADD), which effectively redirects TNF-α/TRAIL-induced death signalling to promote survival and proliferation instead of triggering apoptosis. Splicing factor hnRNPH, which is upregulated in gliomas, controls this splicing event and similarly mediates switching to a ligand-independent, constitutively active Recepteur d?Origine Nantais (RON) tyrosine kinase receptor variant that promotes migration and invasion. The increased cell death and the reduced invasiveness caused by hnRNPH ablation can be rescued by the targeted downregulation of IG20/MADD exon 16- or RON exon 11-containing variants, respectively, using isoform-specific knockdown or splicing redirection approaches. Thus, hnRNPH activity appears to be involved in the pathogenesis and progression of malignant gliomas as the centre of a splicing oncogenic switch, which might reflect reactivation of stem cell patterns and mediates multiple key aspects of aggressive tumour behaviour, including evasion from apoptosis and invasiveness.},

Among them, D83V is the most frequent mutation found in tumor cells. The link between this hotspot mutation and cancer is not well understood. Here we show that the D83V mutation induces a dramatic α-helix to β-strand switch in the MEF2 domain. Located in an α-helix region rich in β-branched residues, the D83V mutation not only removes the extensive helix stabilization interactions but also introduces an additional β-branched residue that further shifts the conformation equilibrium from α-helix to β-strand. Cross-database analyses of cancer mutations and chameleon sequences revealed a number of well-known cancer targets harboring β-strand favoring mutations in chameleon α-helices, suggesting a commonality of such conformational switch in certain cancers and a new factor to consider when stratifying the rapidly expanding cancer mutation data.},

  abstract = {Gene-expression profiling has been used to define 3 molecular subtypes of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), termed germinal center B-cell-like (GCB) DLBCL, activated B-cell-like (ABC) DLBCL, and primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma (PMBL). To investigate whether these DLBCL subtypes arise by distinct pathogenetic mechanisms, we analyzed 203 DLBCL biopsy samples by high-resolution, genome-wide copy number analysis coupled with gene-expression profiling. Of 272 recurrent chromosomal aberrations that were associated with gene-expression alterations, 30 were used differentially by the DLBCL subtypes (P {$<$} 0.006). An amplicon on chromosome 19 was detected in 26\% of ABC DLBCLs but in only 3\% of GCB DLBCLs and PMBLs. A highly up-regulated gene in this amplicon was SPIB, which encodes an ETS family transcription factor. Knockdown of SPIB by RNA interference was toxic to ABC DLBCL cell lines but not to GCB DLBCL, PMBL, or myeloma cell lines, strongly implicating SPIB as an oncogene involved in the pathogenesis of ABC DLBCL. Deletion of the INK4a/ARF tumor suppressor locus and trisomy 3 also occurred almost exclusively in ABC DLBCLs and was associated with inferior outcome within this subtype. FOXP1 emerged as a potential oncogene in ABC DLBCL that was up-regulated by trisomy 3 and by more focal high-level amplifications. In GCB DLBCL, amplification of the oncogenic mir-17-92 microRNA cluster and deletion of the tumor suppressor PTEN were recurrent, but these events did not occur in ABC DLBCL. Together, these data provide genetic evidence that the DLBCL subtypes are distinct diseases that use different oncogenic pathways.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The addition of rituximab to combination chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (CHOP), or R-CHOP, has significantly improved the survival of patients with diffuse large-B-cell lymphoma. Whether gene-expression signatures correlate with survival after treatment of diffuse large-B-cell lymphoma is unclear. METHODS: We profiled gene expression in pretreatment biopsy specimens from 181 patients with diffuse large-B-cell lymphoma who received CHOP and 233 patients with this disease who received R-CHOP. A multivariate gene-expression-based survival-predictor model derived from a training group was tested in a validation group. RESULTS: A multivariate model created from three gene-expression signatures--termed "germinal-center B-cell," "stromal-1," and "stromal-2"--predicted survival both in patients who received CHOP and patients who received R-CHOP. The prognostically favorable stromal-1 signature reflected extracellular-matrix deposition and histiocytic infiltration. By contrast, the prognostically unfavorable stromal-2 signature reflected tumor blood-vessel density. CONCLUSIONS: Survival after treatment of diffuse large-B-cell lymphoma is influenced by differences in immune cells, fibrosis, and angiogenesis in the tumor microenvironment.},

It automatically chooses between local and end-to-end alignments, supports paired-end reads and performs chimeric alignment. The algorithm is robust to sequencing errors and applicable to a wide range of sequence lengths from 70bp to a few megabases. For mapping 100bp sequences, BWA-MEM shows better performance than several state-of-art read aligners to date.

  abstract = {MOTIVATION: Next-generation sequencing technologies generate millions of short sequence reads, which are usually aligned to a reference genome. In many applications, the key information required for downstream analysis is the number of reads mapping to each genomic feature, for example to each exon or each gene. The process of counting reads is called read summarization. Read summarization is required for a great variety of genomic analyses but has so far received relatively little attention in the literature. RESULTS: We present featureCounts, a read summarization program suitable for counting reads generated from either RNA or genomic DNA sequencing experiments. featureCounts implements highly efficient chromosome hashing and feature blocking techniques. It is considerably faster than existing methods (by an order of magnitude for gene-level summarization) and requires far less computer memory. It works with either single or paired-end reads and provides a wide range of options appropriate for different sequencing applications. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: featureCounts is available under GNU General Public License as part of the Subread (http://subread.sourceforge.net) or Rsubread (http://www.bioconductor.org) software packages.},

The association between hnRNP A1 and liver cancer and the functional role of hnRNP A1 in liver cancer have never been reported. Herein, hnRNP A1-specific single-stranded DNA aptamer, BC15, was used to (a) evaluate hnRNP A1 expression in liver cancer, and (b) treat hepatocarcinoma by acting as an inhibitor of hnRNP A1. Results showed that there is high hnRNP A1 expression in liver cancer including serum α-fetoprotein-negative liver cancer tissues compared with either para-cancer or benign controls. Down regulation of hnRNP A1 expression by RNA interference inhibits the proliferation and migration of cancerous HepG2 cells, while overexpression of hnRNP A1 in normal HL-7702 cells increased the proliferation and migration of the cells. Importantly, BC15 showed a stronger inhibiting effect on the proliferation of cultured hepatoma cells than hnRNP A1 small interfering RNA, strongly suggesting that BC15 could also be a potential drug candidate for an hnRNP A1 inhibitor besides its prospect utility in in situ histological examination.},

Here we present a high-quality genome assembly for Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar), and show that large genomic reorganizations, coinciding with bursts of transposon-mediated repeat expansions, were crucial for the post-Ss4R rediploidization process. Comparisons of duplicate gene expression patterns across a wide range of tissues with orthologous genes from a pre-Ss4R outgroup unexpectedly demonstrate far more instances of neofunctionalization than subfunctionalization. Surprisingly, we find that genes that were retained as duplicates after the teleost-specific whole-genome duplication 320 million years ago were not more likely to be retained after the Ss4R, and that the duplicate retention was not influenced to a great extent by the nature of the predicted protein interactions of the gene products. Finally, we demonstrate that the Atlantic salmon assembly can serve as a reference sequence for the study of other salmonids for a range of purposes.},

Although the average 5-y survival rate is 65\% for newly diagnosed RMS, the treatment options for metastatic disease are limited in efficacy, with the 5-y survival rate plummeting to 30\%. Heterogenous nuclear ribonucleoprotein H1 (HNRNPH1) is an RNA-binding protein that is highly expressed in many cancers, including RMS. To determine the role HNRNPH1 plays in RMS tumorigenesis, we investigated its expression and effect on growth in three cellular models of RMS: RD, RH30, and RH41 cells. Upon knockdown of HNRNPH1, growth of all cell lines was reduced, most likely through a combination of apoptosis and cell cycle arrest. We then recapitulated this finding by performing in vivo xenograft studies, in which knockdown of HNRNPH1 resulted in a reduction of tumor formation and growth. We used RNA sequencing to identify changes in gene expression after HNRNPH1 knockdown and found altered splicing of some oncogenes. Our data contribute to understanding the role of HNRNPH1 in RMS development.},

The aim of this study was to determine whether the alteration of hnRNP L affects the stability of bcl-2 mRNA in vivo. Human breast carcinoma MCF-7 cells were transfected with hnRNP L-specific shRNA or hnRNP L-expressing vector to decrease or increase hnRNP L levels, respectively, followed by an actinomycin D chase. An RT-PCR analysis showed that the rate of degradation of endogenous bcl-2 mRNA was not affected by the decrease or increase in the hnRNP L levels. Furthermore, during apoptosis or autophagy, in which bcl-2 expression has been reported to decrease, no difference in the degradation of bcl-2 mRNA was observed between control and hnRNP L-knock down MCF-7 Cells. On the other hand, the levels of AUF-1 and nucleolin, transacting factors for ARE in the 3'UTR of bcl-2 mRNA, were not significantly affected by the decrease in hnRNP L, suggesting that a disturbance in the quantitative balance between these transacting factors is not likely to interfere with the effect of hnRNP L. Collectively, the findings indicate that the decay of bcl-2 mRNA does not appear to be directly controlled by hnRNP L in vivo.},

Similar inhibitory effects were observed when the GFP-HepG2 hepatocarcinoma cells treated with C6-8-conjugated CDots were implanted in nude mice.

  abstract = {Deleted in Azoospermia Associated Protein 1 (DAZAP1) is a ubiquitous RNA-binding protein highly expressed in the human and the mouse testes. It shows a dynamic subcellular localization during spermatogenesis, present predominantly in the nuclei of late-stage spermatocytes and round spermatids and translocated to the cytoplasm during spermatid elongation. To test the hypothesis that DAZAP1 shuttles between the nucleus and the cytoplasm, we studied the nuclear transport of DAZAP1 in somatic cells using immunostaining, heterokaryon formation, and mutagenesis. DAZAP1 is detected exclusively in the nucleus and has the ability to shuttle between the nucleus and the cytoplasm using a highly conserved 25 amino acid segment, designated ZNS, at its C terminus. ZNS shares no sequence homology with other known nuclear localization or export signals. Attachment of ZNS to a red fluorescent protein DsRed2 confers the nucleocytoplasmic shuttling ability to that protein. The nuclear localization of DAZAP1 depends on active transcription. In the presence of an RNA polymerase II inhibitor, DAZAP1 is retained in the cytoplasm. DAZAP1 colocalizes with hnRNP A1 and hnRNP C1 in the nucleus and is a component of the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein particles. Our results suggest that DAZAP1 plays a key role in mRNA transport during spermatogenesis.},

  abstract = {Background: Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) is an oncogene and frequently overexpressed in cancers. However, the regulatory mechanisms of STAT3 expression are not fully understood. Poly(rC)-binding protein1 (PCBP1) is an RNA-binding protein that regulates mRNA stability, splicing, and translation. PCBP1 is a tumor suppressor and can inhibit the translation of several oncogenic genes. Objective: We aimed to understand the regulatory mechanisms of STAT3 expression. Methods: The 5' UTR or 3’ UTR regions of the human STAT3 gene were inserted upstream or downstream of the green fluorescent gene (GFP), respectively, which were used as reporter systems to analyze the inhibitory effects of PCBP1 on the STAT3 gene expression. The deletion and point mutation in 5' UTR were used to search the essential regulatory sequences of the translation inhibition. The mutations of PCBP1 protein were analyzed in the cBioPortal online service. The effects of mutated PCBP1 proteins on STAT3 expression, cancer cell proliferation, and colony formation were analyzed in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) cell lines. Results: PCBP1 inhibits mRNA translation through a motif in the 5' UTR of STAT3. Moreover, we found two leucine residues (Leu100 and Leu102) of PCBP1 protein frequently mutated in cancers. These mutations abolished the inhibition function of PCBP1 on STAT3 translation. Surprisingly, in contrast to wild-type PCBP1 protein, these mutations can promote the growth and colony formation of cancer cells. Conclusion: Overall, we demonstrate that PCBP1 can inhibit the expression of STAT3 through its 5' UTR, and two leucine residues of PCBP1 protein are essential for its functions.},

  abstract = {B cells undergo selection within germinal centers on the basis of their capacity to be activated by antigen held on follicular dendritic cells. Isolated germinal center B cells in culture kill themselves by apoptosis but this is prevented if their receptors for antigen are cross-linked. In this study it is confirmed that almost all germinal center B cells, unlike other B cells, do not express the 25-kDa protein encoded by the bcl-2 oncogene. Cross-linking the surface Ig of isolated germinal center cells causes them to express bcl-2 protein. Two other stimuli which inhibit the entry of germinal center cells to apoptosis result in the expression of bcl-2 protein. These stimuli are: (a) CD40 antibody and (b) recombinant 25-kDa fragment of the CD23 protein plus recombinant interleukin 1 alpha. Respectively, these induce germinal center cells to differentiate to resting B cells or plasmablasts. Dual-fluorescence studies on small lymphocytes confirm the presence of bcl-2 protein in mitochondria but show that this is also present in other extra-nuclear areas. Burkitt lymphoma cells have a phenotype which indicates that they are neoplastic cells of germinal center origin. The expression of bcl-2 protein by Burkitt lymphoma lines was also studied. Burkitt lines which retain the phenotype of fresh Burkitt lymphoma cells can be induced to enter apoptosis on culture with the Ca2+ ionophore ionomycin. These cells were found not to express bcl-2 protein. By contrast, Burkitt lines which have drifted towards a lymphoblastoid cell line phenotype and are resistant to the induction of apoptosis express high levels of the bcl-2 protein. The findings support the concept that the susceptibility of germinal center cells to entering apoptosis is associated with their lack of expression of bcl-2 protein. Aberrant expression of bcl-2 protein by some neoplastic germinal center cells may allow survival in situations where their normal counterparts die.},

Here, we report on a detailed analysis of hnRNPA1 binding to telomere RNA G-quadruplexes with a group of loop variants using an electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) and circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy. We found that the hnRNPA1 binds to RNA G-quadruplexes with the 2'-O-methyl and DNA loops, but fails to bind with the abasic RNA and DNA loops. These results suggested that hnRNPA1 binds to the loop of the RNA G-quadruplex by recognizing the base of the loop's nucleotides. The observation provides the first evidence that the base of the loop's nucleotides is a key factor for hnRNPA1 specifically recognizing the RNA G-quadruplex.},

Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein H1 (HNRNPH1), as a key member of the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins family, is frequently upregulated in multiple cancer cells and involved in tumorigenesis. However, the function of HNRNPH1 in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) remains unclear. In the present study, we revealed that HNRNPH1 expression level was upregulated in CML patients and cell lines. Moreover, the higher level of HNRNPH1 was correlated with disease progression of CML. In vivo and in vitro experiments showed that knockdown of HNRNPH1 inhibited cell proliferation and promoted cell apoptosis in CML cells. Importantly, knockdown of HNRNPH1 in CML cells enhanced sensitivity to imatinib. Mechanically, HNRNPH1 could bind to the mRNA of PTPN6 and negatively regulated its expression. PTPN6 mediated the regulation between HNRNPH1 and PI3K/AKT activation. Furthermore, the HNRNPH1–PTPN6–PI3K/AKT axis played a critical role in CML tumorigenesis and development. The present study first investigated the deregulated HNRNPH1–PTPN6–PI3K/AKT axis moderated cell growth and apoptosis in CML cells, whereby targeting this pathway may be a therapeutic CML treatment.},

  abstract = {RNA-binding proteins control many aspects of cellular biology through binding single-stranded RNA binding motifs (RBMs). However, RBMs can be buried within their local RNA structures, thus inhibiting RNA-protein interactions. N(6)-methyladenosine (m(6)A), the most abundant and dynamic internal modification in eukaryotic messenger RNA, can be selectively recognized by the YTHDF2 protein to affect the stability of cytoplasmic mRNAs, but how m(6)A achieves its wide-ranging physiological role needs further exploration. Here we show in human cells that m(6)A controls the RNA-structure-dependent accessibility of RBMs to affect RNA-protein interactions for biological regulation; we term this mechanism 'the m(6)A-switch'. We found that m(6)A alters the local structure in mRNA and long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) to facilitate binding of heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein C (HNRNPC), an abundant nuclear RNA-binding protein responsible for pre-mRNA processing. Combining photoactivatable-ribonucleoside-enhanced crosslinking and immunoprecipitation (PAR-CLIP) and anti-m(6)A immunoprecipitation (MeRIP) approaches enabled us to identify 39,060 m(6)A-switches among HNRNPC-binding sites; and global m(6)A reduction decreased HNRNPC binding at 2,798 high-confidence m(6)A-switches. We determined that these m(6)A-switch-regulated HNRNPC-binding activities affect the abundance as well as alternative splicing of target mRNAs, demonstrating the regulatory role of m(6)A-switches on gene expression and RNA maturation. Our results illustrate how RNA-binding proteins gain regulated access to their RBMs through m(6)A-dependent RNA structural remodelling, and provide a new direction for investigating RNA-modification-coded cellular biology.},

We generated hnRNP A1 knockout mice to study the role of hnRNP A1 in vivo. The knockout mice, hnRNP A1−/−, showed embryonic lethality because of muscle developmental defects. The blood pressure and heart rate of the heterozygous mice were higher than those of the wild-type mice, indicating heart function defects. We performed mouse exon arrays to study the muscle development mechanism. The processes regulated by hnRNP A1 included cell adhesion and muscle contraction. The expression levels of muscle development-related genes in hnRNP A1+/− mice were significantly different from those in wild-type mice, as detected using qRT-PCR. We further confirmed the alternative splicing patterns of muscle development-related genes including mef2c, lrrfip1, usp28 and abcc9. Alternative mRNA isoforms of these genes were increased in hnRNP A1+/− mice compared with wild-type mice. Furthermore, we revealed that the functionally similar hnRNP A2/B1 did not compensate for the expression of hnRNP A1 in organisms.

Here, we show that m6A increases the accessibility of its surrounding RNA sequence to bind heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein G (HNRNPG). Furthermore, HNRNPG binds m6A-methylated RNAs through its C-terminal low-complexity region, which self-assembles into large particles in vitro. The Arg-Gly-Gly repeats within the low-complexity region are required for binding to the RNA motif exposed by m6A methylation. We identified 13,191 m6A sites in the transcriptome that regulate RNA-HNRNPG interaction and thereby alter the expression and alternative splicing pattern of target mRNAs. Low-complexity regions are pervasive among mRNA binding proteins.

We identified recurrent mutations in genes that are well known to be functionally relevant in DLBCL, including MYD88, CARD11, EZH2, and CREBBP. We also identified somatic mutations in genes for which a functional role in DLBCL has not been previously suspected. These genes include MEF2B, MLL2, BTG1, GNA13, ACTB, P2RY8, PCLO, and TNFRSF14. Further, we show that BCL2 mutations commonly occur in patients with BCL2/IgH rearrangements as a result of somatic hypermutation normally occurring at the IgH locus. The BCL2 point mutations are primarily synonymous, and likely caused by activation-induced cytidine deaminase-mediated somatic hypermutation, as shown by comprehensive analysis of enrichment of mutations in WRCY target motifs. Those nonsynonymous mutations that are observed tend to be found outside of the functionally important BH domains of the protein, suggesting that strong negative selection against BCL2 loss-of-function mutations is at play. Last, by using an algorithm designed to identify likely functionally relevant but infrequent mutations, we identify KRAS, BRAF, and NOTCH1 as likely drivers of DLBCL pathogenesis in some patients. Our data provide an unbiased view of the landscape of mutations in DLBCL, and this in turn may point toward new therapeutic strategies for the disease.},

  abstract = {Pediatric-type nodal follicular lymphoma (PTNFL) is a variant of follicular lymphoma (FL) characterized by limited-stage presentation and invariably benign behavior despite often high-grade histological appearance. It is important to distinguish PTNFL from typical FL in order to avoid unnecessary treatment; however, this distinction relies solely on clinical and pathological criteria, which may be variably applied. To define the genetic landscape of PTNFL, we performed copy number analysis and exome and/or targeted sequencing of 26 PTNFLs (16 pediatric and 10 adult). The most commonly mutated gene in PTNFL was MAP2K1, encoding MEK1, with a mutation frequency of 43\%. All MAP2K1 mutations were activating missense mutations localized to exons 2 and 3, which encode negative regulatory and catalytic domains, respectively. Missense mutations in MAPK1 (2/22) and RRAS (1/22) were identified in cases that lacked MAP2K1 mutations. The second most commonly mutated gene in PTNFL was TNFRSF14, with a mutation frequency of 29\%, similar to that seen in limited-stage typical FL (P = .35). PTNFL was otherwise genomically bland and specifically lacked recurrent mutations in epigenetic modifiers (eg, CREBBP, KMT2D). Copy number aberrations affected a mean of only 0.5\% of PTNFL genomes, compared with 10\% of limited-stage typical FL genomes (P {$<$} .02). Importantly, the mutational profiles of PTNFLs in children and adults were highly similar. Together, these findings define PTNFL as a biologically and clinically distinct indolent lymphoma of children and adults characterized by a high prevalence of MAPK pathway mutations and a near absence of mutations in epigenetic modifiers.},

We further sequenced the exomes of 59 Burkitt lymphoma tumors and compared them to sequenced exomes from 94 diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) tumors. We identified 70 genes that were recurrently mutated in Burkitt lymphomas, including ID3, GNA13, RET, PIK3R1 and the SWI/SNF genes ARID1A and SMARCA4. Our data implicate a number of genes in cancer for the first time, including CCT6B, SALL3, FTCD and PC. ID3 mutations occurred in 34\% of Burkitt lymphomas and not in DLBCLs. We show experimentally that ID3 mutations promote cell cycle progression and proliferation. Our work thus elucidates commonly occurring gene-coding mutations in Burkitt lymphoma and implicates ID3 as a new tumor suppressor gene.},

Here we systematically analyse 4,034 cases from The Cancer Genome Atlas cancer cases representing 12 cancer types. We find that the frequency of rare germline truncations in 114 cancer-susceptibility-associated genes varies widely, from 4\% (acute myeloid leukaemia (AML)) to 19\% (ovarian cancer), with a notably high frequency of 11\% in stomach cancer. Burden testing identifies 13 cancer genes with significant enrichment of rare truncations, some associated with specific cancers (for example, RAD51C, PALB2 and MSH6 in AML, stomach and endometrial cancers, respectively). Significant, tumour-specific loss of heterozygosity occurs in nine genes (ATM, BAP1, BRCA1/2, BRIP1, FANCM, PALB2 and RAD51C/D). Moreover, our homology-directed repair assay of 68 BRCA1 rare missense variants supports the utility of allelic enrichment analysis for characterizing variants of unknown significance. The scale of this analysis and the somatic-germline integration enable the detection of rare variants that may affect individual susceptibility to tumour development, a critical step toward precision medicine.},

Here, after developing protocols for expansion of single-cell lymphocyte cultures, we sequenced whole genomes from 717 normal naive and memory B and T cells and haematopoietic stem cells. All lymphocyte subsets carried more point mutations and structural variants than haematopoietic stem cells, with higher burdens in memory cells than in naive cells, and with T cells accumulating mutations at a higher rate throughout life. Off-target effects of immunological diversification accounted for approximately half of the additional differentiation-associated mutations in lymphocytes. Memory B cells acquired, on average, 18 off-target mutations genome-wide for every on-target IGHV mutation during the germinal centre reaction. Structural variation was 16-fold higher in lymphocytes than in stem cells, with around 15\% of deletions being attributable to off-target recombinase-activating gene activity. DNA damage from ultraviolet light exposure and other sporadic mutational processes generated hundreds to thousands of mutations in some memory cells. The mutation burden and signatures of normal B cells were broadly similar to those seen in many B-cell cancers, suggesting that malignant transformation of lymphocytes arises from the same mutational processes that are active across normal ontogeny. The mutational landscape of normal lymphocytes chronicles the off-target effects of programmed genome engineering during immunological diversification and the consequences of differentiation, proliferation and residency in diverse microenvironments.},

  abstract = {Both sequence variation and copy-number variation (CNV) of the genes encoding receptors for immunoglobulin G (Fcγ receptors) have been genetically and functionally associated with a number of autoimmune diseases. However, the molecular nature and evolutionary context of this variation is unknown. Here, we describe the structure of the CNV, estimate its mutation rate and diversity, and place it in the context of the known functional alloantigen variation of these genes. Deletion of Fcγ receptor IIIB, associated with systemic lupus erythematosus, is a result of independent nonallelic homologous recombination events with a frequency of approximately 0.1\%. We also show that pathogen diversity, in particular helminth diversity, has played a critical role in shaping the functional variation at these genes both between mammalian species and between human populations. Positively selected amino acids are involved in the interaction with IgG and include some amino acids that are known polymorphic alloantigens in humans. This supports a genetic contribution to the hygiene hypothesis, which states that past evolution in the context of helminth diversity has left humans with an array of susceptibility alleles for autoimmune disease in the context of a helminth-free environment. This approach shows the link between pathogens and autoimmune disease at the genetic level and provides a strategy for interrogating the genetic variation underlying autoimmune-disease risk and infectious-disease susceptibility.}

More indolent presentations have been described including patients who can defer initial therapy without adverse impact on survival. The 2016 World Health Organization updated classification describes 2 major subtypes, classical and leukemic nonnodal MCL, each with unique molecular features and clinical presentations. Although there is no standard of care for MCL, aggressive chemo-immunotherapy regimens containing rituximab and cytarabine, followed by consolidation with autologous stem cell transplantation and maintenance rituximab, are the most used approach in young fit patients, and chemo-immunotherapy, followed by rituximab maintenance, is most commonly used in older patients. Despite the improvement in response durations with currently available therapies, patients will inevitably relapse. A number of targeted therapies are approved in the relapsed setting and are now under evaluation in combination with standard frontline therapy. Although the approval of ibrutinib changed the landscape of therapy for relapsed MCL, prognosis remains poor after progression on ibrutinib supporting the development of ibrutinib combinations to prolong response duration as well as the development of other novel agents for ibrutinib refractory disease. With ibrutinib being incorporated into initial therapy regimens, new options will be needed at relapse. Prognostic markers, such as minimal residual disease, have been shown to correlate independently with outcomes along with predicting relapse, with the potential to guide therapeutic decisions. The future treatment of MCL therapy will need to incorporate therapy based on risk-stratification and nonchemotherapeutic approaches.},

The role of nuclear-enriched abundant transcript 1 (NEAT1), an essential lncRNA for the formation of nuclear body paraspeckles, has not been fully explored in HCC. We aimed to determine the expression, roles and functional mechanisms of NEAT1 in the proliferation and invasion of HCC. Based on real-time polymerase chain reaction data, we suggest that NEAT1 is upregulated in HCC tissues compared with noncancerous liver tissues. The knockdown of NEAT1 altered global gene expression patterns and reduced HCC cell proliferation, invasion and migration. RNA immunoprecipitation and RNA pull-down assays confirmed that U2AF65 binds to NEAT1. Furthermore, the study indicated that NEAT1 regulated hnRNP A2 expression and that this regulation may be associated with the NEAT1\&ndash;U2AF65 protein complex. Thus, the NEAT1-hnRNP A2 regulation mechanism promotes HCC pathogenesis and may provide a potential target for the prognosis and treatment of HCC.

Here, we searched for new NBs that are built on unidentified arcRNAs by screening for ribonuclease (RNase)-sensitive NBs using 32,651 fluorescently tagged human cDNA clones. We identified 32 tagged proteins that required RNA for their localization in distinct nuclear foci. Among them, seven RNA-binding proteins commonly localized in the Sam68 nuclear body (SNB), which was disrupted by RNase treatment. Knockdown of each SNB protein revealed that SNBs are composed of two distinct RNase-sensitive substructures. One substructure is present as a distinct NB, termed the DBC1 body, in certain conditions, and the more dynamic substructure including Sam68 joins to form the intact SNB. HNRNPL acts as the adaptor to combine the two substructures and form the intact SNB through the interaction of two sets of RNA recognition motifs with the putative arcRNAs in the respective substructures.}

  abstract = {Despite the many efforts already spent to enumerate somatic mutations in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), previous whole-genome and whole-exome studies conducted on patients of mixed outcomes failed at characterizing the 30\% of patients who will relapse or resist current immunochemotherapies. To address this issue, we performed whole-exome sequencing of normal/tumoral DNA pairs in 14 relapsed/refractory (R/R) patients subclassified by full-transcriptome arrays (six activated B-cell like, three germinal center B-cell like, and five primary mediastinal B-cell lymphomas), from the LNH-03 LYSA clinical trial program. Aside from well-known DLBCL features, gene and pathway level recurrence analyses proposed several interesting leads including TBL1XR1 and activating mutations in IRF4 or in the insulin regulation pathway. Sequencing-based copy number analysis defined 23 short recurrently altered regions involving genes such as REL, CDKN2A, HYAL2, and TP53. Moreover, it highlighted mutations in genes such as GNA13, CARD11, MFHAS1, and PCLO as associated with secondary variant allele amplification events. The five primary mediastinal B-cell lymphomas (PMBL), while unexpected in a R/R cohort, showed a significantly higher mutation rate (P = 0.003) and provided many insights on this classical Hodgkin lymphoma related subtype. Novel genes such as XPO1, MFHAS1, and ITPKB were found particularly mutated, along with various cytokine-based signaling pathways. Among these analyses, somatic events in the NF-κB pathway were found preponderant in the three DLBCL subtypes, confirming its major implication in DLBCL aggressiveness and pinpointing several new candidate genes.},

  abstract = {HnRNPA2B1 encodes an RNA binding protein associated with neurodegeneration. However, its function in the nervous system is unclear. Transcriptome-wide crosslinking and immunoprecipitation in mouse spinal cord discover UAGG motifs enriched within ∼2,500 hnRNP A2/B1 binding sites and an unexpected role for hnRNP A2/B1 in alternative polyadenylation. HnRNP A2/B1 loss results in alternative splicing (AS), including skipping of an exon in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)-associated D-amino acid oxidase (DAO) that reduces D-serine metabolism. ALS-associated hnRNP A2/B1 D290V mutant patient fibroblasts and motor neurons differentiated from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC-MNs) demonstrate abnormal splicing changes, likely due to increased nuclear-insoluble hnRNP A2/B1. Mutant iPSC-MNs display decreased survival in long-term culture and exhibit hnRNP A2/B1 localization to cytoplasmic granules as well as exacerbated changes in gene expression and splicing upon cellular stress. Our findings provide a cellular resource and reveal RNA networks relevant to neurodegeneration, regulated by normal and mutant hnRNP A2/B1. Video Abstract},

  abstract = {Upon encountering antigens, mature IgM-positive B lymphocytes undergo class-switch recombination (CSR) wherein exons encoding the default Cμ constant coding gene segment of the immunoglobulin (Ig) heavy-chain (Igh) locus are excised and replaced with a new constant gene segment (referred to as “Ch genes”, e.g., Cγ, Cε, or Cα). The B cell thereby changes from expressing IgM to one producing IgG, IgE, or IgA, with each antibody isotype having a different effector function during an immune reaction. CSR is a DNA deletional-recombination reaction that proceeds through the generation of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) in repetitive switch (S) sequences preceding each Ch gene and is completed by end-joining between donor Sμ and acceptor S regions. CSR is a multistep reaction requiring transcription through S regions, the DNA cytidine deaminase AID, and the participation of several general DNA repair pathways including base excision repair, mismatch repair, and classical nonhomologous end-joining. In this review, we discuss our current understanding of how transcription through S regions generates substrates for AID-mediated deamination and how AID participates not only in the initiation of CSR but also in the conversion of deaminated residues into DSBs. Additionally, we review the multiple processes that regulate AID expression and facilitate its recruitment specifically to the Ig loci, and how deregulation of AID specificity leads to oncogenic translocations. Finally, we summarize recent data on the potential role of AID in the maintenance of the pluripotent stem cell state during epigenetic reprogramming.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: Studies of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) are typically evaluated by using a time-to-event approach with relapse, re-treatment, and death commonly used as the events. We evaluated the timing and type of events in newly diagnosed DLBCL and compared patient outcome with reference population data. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with newly diagnosed DLBCL treated with immunochemotherapy were prospectively enrolled onto the University of Iowa/Mayo Clinic Specialized Program of Research Excellence Molecular Epidemiology Resource (MER) and the North Central Cancer Treatment Group NCCTG-N0489 clinical trial from 2002 to 2009. Patient outcomes were evaluated at diagnosis and in the subsets of patients achieving event-free status at 12 months (EFS12) and 24 months (EFS24) from diagnosis. Overall survival was compared with age- and sex-matched population data. Results were replicated in an external validation cohort from the Groupe d'Etude des Lymphomes de l'Adulte (GELA) Lymphome Non Hodgkinien 2003 (LNH2003) program and a registry based in Lyon, France. RESULTS: In all, 767 patients with newly diagnosed DLBCL who had a median age of 63 years were enrolled onto the MER and NCCTG studies. At a median follow-up of 60 months (range, 8 to 116 months), 299 patients had an event and 210 patients had died. Patients achieving EFS24 had an overall survival equivalent to that of the age- and sex-matched general population (standardized mortality ratio [SMR], 1.18; P = .25). This result was confirmed in 820 patients from the GELA study and registry in Lyon (SMR, 1.09; P = .71). Simulation studies showed that EFS24 has comparable power to continuous EFS when evaluating clinical trials in DLBCL. CONCLUSION: Patients with DLBCL who achieve EFS24 have a subsequent overall survival equivalent to that of the age- and sex-matched general population. EFS24 will be useful in patient counseling and should be considered as an end point for future studies of newly diagnosed DLBCL.},

However, the massive data sets generated by NGS--the 1000 Genome pilot alone includes nearly five terabases--make writing feature-rich, efficient, and robust analysis tools difficult for even computationally sophisticated individuals. Indeed, many professionals are limited in the scope and the ease with which they can answer scientific questions by the complexity of accessing and manipulating the data produced by these machines. Here, we discuss our Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK), a structured programming framework designed to ease the development of efficient and robust analysis tools for next-generation DNA sequencers using the functional programming philosophy of MapReduce. The GATK provides a small but rich set of data access patterns that encompass the majority of analysis tool needs. Separating specific analysis calculations from common data management infrastructure enables us to optimize the GATK framework for correctness, stability, and CPU and memory efficiency and to enable distributed and shared memory parallelization. We highlight the capabilities of the GATK by describing the implementation and application of robust, scale-tolerant tools like coverage calculators and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) calling. We conclude that the GATK programming framework enables developers and analysts to quickly and easily write efficient and robust NGS tools, many of which have already been incorporated into large-scale sequencing projects like the 1000 Genomes Project and The Cancer Genome Atlas.},

  abstract = {Transcription, splicing, and translation are potentially coordinately regulatable in a temporospatial-dependent manner, although supporting experimental evidence for this notion is scarce. Yeast two-hybrid screening of a mammary gland cDNA library with human p21-activated kinase 1 (Pak1) as bait identified polyC-RNA-binding protein 1 (PCBP1), which controls translation from mRNAs containing the DICE (differentiation control element). Mitogenic stimulation of human cells phosphorylated PCBP1 on threonines 60 and 127 in a Pak1-sensitive manner. Pak1-dependent phosphorylation of PCBP1 released its binding and translational inhibition from a DICE-minigene. Overexpression of PCBP1 also inhibited the translation of the endogenous L1 cell adhesion molecule mRNA, which contains two DICE motifs in the 3′ untranslated region. We also found that Pak1 activation led to an increased nuclear retention of PCBP1, recruitment to the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) promoter, and stimulation of eIF4E expression in a Pak1-sensitive manner. Moreover, mitogenic stimulation promoted Pak1- and PCBP1-dependent alternative splicing and exon inclusion from a CD44 minigene. The alternative splicing functions of PCBP1 were in turn mediated by its intrinsic interaction with Caper α, a U2 snRNP auxiliary factor-related protein previously implicated in RNA splicing. These findings establish the principle that a single coregulator can function as a signal-dependent and coordinated regulator of transcription, splicing, and translation.},

Here we show that M9 is also a nuclear export signal; placing M9 on a protein that is otherwise restricted to the nucleus, the nucleoplasmin core domain (NPc), efficiently exports it to the cytoplasm in a temperature-dependent manner. In contrast, classical NLSs cannot promote the export of NPc. These findings demonstrate that there is a signal-dependent, temperature-sensitive nuclear export pathway and strengthen the suggestion that A1 and other shuttling hnRNPs function as carriers for RNA during export to the cytoplasm.},

  abstract = {Protein import into the nucleus and export from the nucleus are signal-mediated processes that require energy. The nuclear transport process about which the most information is currently available is classical nuclear localization signal (NLS)-mediated nuclear import. However, details concerning the signal-mediated export of proteins and RNAs as well as alternative nuclear import pathways are beginning to emerge. An example of this is the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) A1 protein which, by virtue of its M9 domain, is actively exported from the nucleus and imported into the nucleus via a novel pathway mediated by the recently characterized transportin protein. Here we report that the shuttling hnRNP K protein contains a novel shuttling domain (termed KNS) which has many of the characteristics of M9, in that it confers bi-directional transport across the nuclear envelope. KNS-mediated nuclear import is dependent on RNA polymerase II transcription, and we show that a classical NLS can override this effect. Furthermore, KNS accesses a separate import pathway from either classical NLSs or M9. This demonstrates the existence of a third protein import pathway into the nucleus and thereby defines a new type of nuclear import/export signal.},

The present work demonstrates that both of these molecules contribute to CT element-activated transcription in vitro. The pyrimidine-rich strand of the CT element both bound to hnRNP K and competitively inhibited transcription in vitro, suggesting a role for hnRNP K in activating transcription through this single-stranded sequence. Direct addition of recombinant hnRNP K to reaction mixtures programmed with templates bearing single-stranded CT elements increased specific RNA synthesis. If hnRNP K is a transcription factor, then interactions with the RNA polymerase II transcription apparatus are predicted. Affinity columns charged with recombinant hnRNP K specifically bind a component(s) necessary for transcription activation. The depleted factors were biochemically complemented by a crude TFIID phosphocellulose fraction, indicating that hnRNP K might interact with the TATA-binding protein (TBP)-TBP-associated factor complex. Coimmunoprecipitation of a complex formed in vivo between hnRNP K and epitope-tagged TBP as well as binding in vitro between recombinant proteins demonstrated a protein-protein interaction between TBP and hnRNP K. Furthermore, when the two proteins were overexpressed in vivo, transcription from a CT element-dependent reporter was synergistically activated. These data indicate that hnRNP K binds to a specific cis element, interacts with the RNA polymerase II transcription machinery, and stimulates transcription and thus has all of the properties of a transcription factor.},

We identify over one hundred miR-17-19b targets, of which 40\% are co-regulated by c-MYC. Downregulation of a new miR-17/20 target, checkpoint kinase 2 (Chek2), increases the recruitment of HuR to c-MYC transcripts, resulting in the inhibition of c-MYC translation and thus interfering with in vivo tumor growth. Hence, in established lymphomas, miR-17-19b fine-tunes c-MYC activity through a tight control of its function and expression, ultimately ensuring cancer cell homeostasis. Our data highlight the plasticity of miRNA function, reflecting changes in the mRNA landscape and 3' UTR shortening at different stages of tumorigenesis.},

TGF-beta signaling involves ligand-dependent activation of receptor serine/threonine kinases, activation and subsequent nuclear translocation of pathway-specific transcription factors (Smads), and ultimately, modulation of gene expression. While Smad-dependent responses represent the primary signaling components activated by TGF-beta receptors, their function is controlled by a variety of cofactors. In addition, alternative signaling systems mediating TGF-beta-induced effects have recently been described such as MAP kinase pathways. To uncover novel proteins that participate in TGF-beta signaling via nuclear/cytoplasmic shuttling in lung epithelial cells, we have analyzed A549 human lung epithelial cells, using subcellular fractionation combined with 2-D PAGE, tryptic digestion, and MS. We identified a rapid increase in the cytosolic localization of KH-type splicing regulatory protein (KHSRP), far upstream element-binding protein (FUBP1), hnRNP-L, and hnRNP-H1, concomitant with a decrease in their nuclear localization in response to TGF-beta1. Proteomic data were confirmed by immunofluorescence and immunoblot analyses. In summary, we represent a powerful novel technology for the identification of previously unknown signaling intermediates.},

The full spectrum of LPD seen in humans occurs in dogs, but the incidence and lifetime risk of naturally occurring LPD differs among dog breeds. Taking advantage of the limited genetic heterogeneity that exists within dog breeds, we tested the hypothesis that the prevalence of LPD immunophenotypes would differ among different breeds. The sample population included 1,263 dogs representing 87 breeds. Immunophenotype was determined by the presence of clonal rearrangements of immunoglobulin heavy chain or T-cell receptor γ chain. The probability of observing the number of B-cell or T-cell tumors in a particular breed or breed group was compared with three reference populations. Significance was computed using χ2 test, and logistic regression was used to confirm binomial predictions. The data show that, among 87 breeds tested, 15 showed significant differences from the prevalence of LPD immunophenotypes seen across the dog population as a whole. More significantly, elevated risk for T-cell LPD seems to have arisen ancestrally and is retained in related breed groups, whereas increased risk for B-cell disease may stem from different risk factors, or combinations of risk factors, arising during the process of breed derivation and selection. The data show that domestic dogs provide a unique and valuable resource to define factors that mediate risk as well as genes involved in the initiation of B-cell and T-cell LPD.},

By integrating copy number data with transcriptional profiles and performing pathway analysis in primary DLBCLs, we identified a comprehensive set of copy number alterations (CNAs) that decreased p53 activity and perturbed cell cycle regulation. Primary tumors either had multiple complementary alterations of p53 and cell cycle components or largely lacked these lesions. DLBCLs with p53 and cell cycle pathway CNAs had decreased abundance of p53 target transcripts and increased expression of E2F target genes and the Ki67 proliferation marker. CNAs of the CDKN2A-TP53-RB-E2F axis provide a structural basis for increased proliferation in DLBCL, predict outcome with current therapy, and suggest targeted treatment approaches.}

We describe here in vitro experiments demonstrating that this USE enhances both the cleavage and poly(A) addition reactions. We also show that the C2 USE can be cross-linked efficiently to a 55-kD protein that we identify as the polypyrimidine tract-binding protein (PTB), implicated previously in modulation of pre-mRNA splicing. Mutation of the PTB-binding site significantly reduces the efficiency of the C2 poly(A) site both in vivo and in vitro. Furthermore, addition of PTB to reconstituted processing reactions enhances cleavage at the C2 poly(A) site, indicating that PTB has a direct role in recognition of this signal. The C2 USE, however, also increases the affinity of general polyadenylation factors independently for the C2 poly(A) signal as detected by enhanced binding of cleavage-stimulaton factor (CstF). Strikingly, this leads to a novel CstF-dependant enhancement of the poly(A) synthesis phase of the reaction. These studies both emphasize the interconnection between splicing and polyadenylation and indicate an unexpected flexibility in the organization of mammalian poly(A) sites.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: Relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (rrDLBCL) is fatal in 90\% of patients, and yet little is known about its biology. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Using exome sequencing, we characterized the mutation profiles of 38 rrDLBCL biopsies obtained at the time of progression after immunochemotherapy. To identify genes that may be associated with relapse, we compared the mutation frequency in samples obtained at relapse to an unrelated cohort of 138 diagnostic DLBCLs and separately amplified specific mutations in their matched diagnostic samples to identify clonal expansions. RESULTS: On the basis of a higher frequency at relapse and evidence for clonal selection, TP53, FOXO1, MLL3 (KMT2C), CCND3, NFKBIZ, and STAT6 emerged as top candidate genes implicated in therapeutic resistance. We observed individual examples of clonal expansions affecting genes whose mutations had not been previously associated with DLBCL including two regulators of NF-κB: NFKBIE and NFKBIZ We detected mutations that may be affect sensitivity to novel therapeutics, such as MYD88 and CD79B mutations, in 31\% and 23\% of patients with activated B-cell-type of rrDLBCL, respectively. We also identified recurrent STAT6 mutations affecting D419 in 36\% of patients with the germinal center B (GCB) cell rrDLBCL. These were associated with activated JAK/STAT signaling, increased phospho-STAT6 protein expression and increased expression of STAT6 target genes. CONCLUSIONS: This work improves our understanding of therapeutic resistance in rrDLBCL and has identified novel therapeutic opportunities especially for the high-risk patients with GCB-type rrDLBCL.

  abstract = {The term diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) includes a heterogeneous collection of biologically distinct tumours. This heterogeneity currently presents a barrier to the successful deployment of novel, biologically targeted therapies. Molecular profiling studies have recently proposed new molecular classification systems. These have the potential to resolve the biological heterogeneity of DLBCL into manageable subgroups of tumours that rely on shared oncogenic programmes. In many cases these biological programmes straddle the boundaries of our existing systems for classifying B-cell lymphomas. Here we review the findings from these major molecular profiling studies with a specific focus on those that propose new genetic subgroups of DLBCL. We highlight the areas of consensus and discordance between these studies and discuss the implications for current clinical practice and for clinical trials. Finally, we address the outstanding challenges and solutions to the introduction of genomic subtyping and precision medicine in DLBCL.},

  abstract = {Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is a genetically heterogeneous cancer composed of at least 2 molecular subtypes that differ in gene expression and distribution of mutations. Recently, application of genome/exome sequencing and RNA-seq to DLBCL has revealed numerous genes that are recurrent targets of somatic point mutation in this disease. Here we provide a whole-genome-sequencing-based perspective of DLBCL mutational complexity by characterizing 40 de novo DLBCL cases and 13 DLBCL cell lines and combining these data with DNA copy number analysis and RNA-seq from an extended cohort of 96 cases. Our analysis identified widespread genomic rearrangements including evidence for chromothripsis as well as the presence of known and novel fusion transcripts. We uncovered new gene targets of recurrent somatic point mutations and genes that are targeted by focal somatic deletions in this disease. We highlight the recurrence of germinal center B-cell-restricted mutations affecting genes that encode the S1P receptor and 2 small GTPases (GNA13 and GNAI2) that together converge on regulation of B-cell homing. We further analyzed our data to approximate the relative temporal order in which some recurrent mutations were acquired and demonstrate that ongoing acquisition of mutations and intratumoral clonal heterogeneity are common features of DLBCL. This study further improves our understanding of the processes and pathways involved in lymphomagenesis, and some of the pathways mutated here may indicate new avenues for therapeutic intervention.},

Targeted resequencing studies have revealed mutations in various genes encoding proteins in the NF-kappaB pathway that contribute to the activated B-cell (ABC) DLBCL subtype, but thus far few GCB-specific mutations have been identified. Here we report recurrent somatic mutations affecting the polycomb-group oncogene EZH2, which encodes a histone methyltransferase responsible for trimethylating Lys27 of histone H3 (H3K27). After the recent discovery of mutations in KDM6A (UTX), which encodes the histone H3K27me3 demethylase UTX, in several cancer types, EZH2 is the second histone methyltransferase gene found to be mutated in cancer. These mutations, which result in the replacement of a single tyrosine in the SET domain of the EZH2 protein (Tyr641), occur in 21.7\% of GCB DLBCLs and 7.2\% of FLs and are absent from ABC DLBCLs. Our data are consistent with the notion that EZH2 proteins with mutant Tyr641 have reduced enzymatic activity in vitro.},

We also detected intron 1 mutations in 47\% of the cases, and detailed sequence analysis strongly suggests AID-mediated aberrant somatic hypermutation as the mutational mechanism. Furthermore, we demonstrate that genomic lesions in CIITA result in decreased protein expression and reduction of MHC class II surface expression, creating an immune privilege phenotype in PMBCL. In summary, we establish CIITA alterations as a common mechanism of immune escape through reduction of MHC class II expression in PMBCL, with potential implications for future treatments targeting microenvironment-related biology.},

Furthermore, molecular studies, including global gene expression profiling, have provided evidence that PMBL is more closely related to classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL). Although targeted sequencing studies have revealed a number of mutations involved in PMBL pathogenesis, a comprehensive description of disease-associated genetic alterations and perturbed pathways is still lacking. Here, we performed whole-exome sequencing of 95 PMBL tumors to inform on oncogenic driver genes and recurrent copy number alterations. The integration of somatic gene mutations with gene expression signatures provides further insights into genotype-phenotype interrelation in PMBL. We identified highly recurrent oncogenic mutations in the Janus kinase-signal transducer and activator of transcription and nuclear factor κB pathways, and provide additional evidence of the importance of immune evasion in PMBL (CIITA, CD58, B2M, CD274, and PDCD1LG2). Our analyses highlight the interferon response factor (IRF) pathway as a putative novel hallmark with frequent alterations in multiple pathway members (IRF2BP2, IRF4, and IRF8). In addition, our integrative analysis illustrates the importance of JAK1, RELB, and EP300 mutations driving oncogenic signaling. The identified driver genes were significantly more frequently mutated in PMBL compared with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, whereas only a limited number of genes were significantly different between PMBL and cHL, emphasizing the close relation between these entities. Our study, performed on a large cohort of PMBL, highlights the importance of distinctive genetic alterations for disease taxonomy with relevance for diagnostic evaluation and therapeutic decision-making.},

Currently, the diagnosis relies on consensus of histopathology, clinical variables, and presentation, giving rise to diagnostic inaccuracy in routine practice. Previous studies have demonstrated that PMBCL can be distinguished from subtypes of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) based on gene expression signatures. However, requirement of fresh-frozen biopsy material has precluded the transfer of gene expression–based assays to the clinic. Here, we developed a robust and accurate molecular classification assay (Lymph3Cx) for the distinction of PMBCL from DLBCL subtypes based on gene expression measurements in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue. A probabilistic model accounting for classification error, comprising 58 gene features, was trained on 68 cases of PMBCL and DLBCL. Performance of the model was subsequently evaluated in an independent validation cohort of 158 cases and showed high agreement of the Lymph3Cx molecular classification with the clinicopathological diagnosis of an expert panel (frank misclassification rate, 3.8\%). Furthermore, we demonstrate reproducibility of the assay with 100\% concordance of subtype assignments at 2 independent laboratories. Future studies will determine Lymph3Cx’s utility for routine diagnostic purposes and therapeutic decision making.,},

Currently, a complete Ig characterization cannot be extracted from whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data due to the inherent complexity of the Ig loci. Here, we introduce IgCaller, an algorithm designed to fully characterize Ig gene rearrangements and oncogenic translocations from short-read WGS data. Using a cohort of 404 patients comprising different subtypes of B cell neoplasms, we demonstrate that IgCaller identifies both heavy and light chain rearrangements to provide additional information on their functionality, somatic mutational status, class switch recombination, and oncogenic Ig translocations. Our data thus support IgCaller to be a reliable alternative to Sanger sequencing and FISH for studying the genetic properties of the Ig loci.},

Having genotyped {$>$}4000 individuals, we show that all CNV at this locus can be explained by nonallelic homologous recombination (NAHR) of the two paralogous repeats that constitute the majority of the locus, and describe four distinct CNV regions (CNRs) with a highly variable prevalence in the population. Apart from CNV, NAHR events also created several hitherto unidentified chimeric FCGR2 genes. These include an FCGR2A/2C chimeric gene that causes a decreased expression of FcγRIIa on phagocytes, resulting in a decreased production of reactive oxygen species in response to immune complexes, compared with wild-type FCGR2A. Conversely, FCGR2C/2A chimeric genes were identified to lead to an increased expression of FCGR2C. Finally, a rare FCGR2B null-variant allele was found, in which a polymorphic stop codon of FCGR2C is introduced into one FCGR2B gene, resulting in a 50\% reduction in protein expression. Our study on CNRs and the chimeric genes is essential for the correct interpretation of association studies on FCGR genes as a determinant for disease susceptibility, and may explain some as yet unidentified extreme phenotypes of immune-mediated disease.}

Post transcriptional regulation of interferon-γ-inducible protein (IP)-10 has been uncharacterized in diabetes conditions. RNA-affinity capture method and RNA immuno-precipitation revealed S100b treatment increased the binding of heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP)K to the IP-10 3′UTR and increased IP-10 mRNA accumulation. Luciferase activity assay using reporter plasmids showed involvement of IP-10 3′UTR. Knocking down of hnRNPK destabilized S100b induced IP-10 mRNA accumulation. S100b promoted the translocation of hnRNPK from nucleus to the cytoplasm and this was confirmed by phosphomimetic S284/353D mutant and non-phosphatable S284/353A hnRNPK mutant. S100b treatment demethylates hnRNPK at Lys219 by Lysine Specific Demethylase (LSD)-1. HnRNPKK219I, a demethylation defective mutant increased IP-10 mRNA stability. Apparently, triple mutant hnRNPKK219I/S284D/353D promoted IP-10 mRNA stability. Interestingly, knocking down LSD-1 abolished S100b induced IP-10 mRNA accumulation. These observations show for the first time that IP-10 mRNA stability is dynamically regulated by Lysine demethylation of hnRNPK by LSD-1. These results indicate that hnRNPK plays an important role in IP-10 mRNA stability induced by S100b which could exacerbate monocyte activation, relevant to the pathogenesis of diabetic complications like atherosclerosis.},

Deregulation of KH-domain protein expression is frequently associated with severe developmental defects and neoplasia.

  abstract = {Acetylcholinesterase (AChE), encoded by the ACHE gene, hydrolyzes the neurotransmitter acetylcholine to terminate synaptic transmission. Alternative splicing close to the 3΄ end generates three distinct isoforms of AChET, AChEH and AChER. We found that hnRNP H binds to two specific G-runs in exon 5a of human ACHE and activates the distal alternative 3΄ splice site (ss) between exons 5a and 5b to generate AChET. Specific effect of hnRNP H was corroborated by siRNA-mediated knockdown and artificial tethering of hnRNP H. Furthermore, hnRNP H competes for binding of CstF64 to the overlapping binding sites in exon 5a, and suppresses the selection of a cryptic polyadenylation site (PAS), which additionally ensures transcription of the distal 3΄ ss required for the generation of AChET. Expression levels of hnRNP H were positively correlated with the proportions of the AChET isoform in three different cell lines. HnRNP H thus critically generates AChET by enhancing the distal 3΄ ss and by suppressing the cryptic PAS. Global analysis of CLIP-seq and RNA-seq also revealed that hnRNP H competitively regulates alternative 3΄ ss and alternative PAS in other genes. We propose that hnRNP H is an essential factor that competitively regulates alternative splicing and alternative polyadenylation.}

  abstract = {The activated B-cell-like (ABC) subtype of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) remains the least curable form of this malignancy despite recent advances in therapy. Constitutive nuclear factor (NF)-κB and JAK kinase signalling promotes malignant cell survival in these lymphomas, but the genetic basis for this signalling is incompletely understood. Here we describe the dependence of ABC DLBCLs on MYD88, an adaptor protein that mediates toll and interleukin (IL)-1 receptor signalling, and the discovery of highly recurrent oncogenic mutations affecting MYD88 in ABC DLBCL tumours. RNA interference screening revealed that MYD88 and the associated kinases IRAK1 and IRAK4 are essential for ABC DLBCL survival. High-throughput RNA resequencing uncovered MYD88 mutations in ABC DLBCL lines. Notably, 29\% of ABC DLBCL tumours harboured the same amino acid substitution, L265P, in the MYD88 Toll/IL-1 receptor (TIR) domain at an evolutionarily invariant residue in its hydrophobic core. This mutation was rare or absent in other DLBCL subtypes and Burkitt's lymphoma, but was observed in 9\% of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphomas. At a lower frequency, additional mutations were observed in the MYD88 TIR domain, occurring in both the ABC and germinal centre B-cell-like (GCB) DLBCL subtypes. Survival of ABC DLBCL cells bearing the L265P mutation was sustained by the mutant but not the wild-type MYD88 isoform, demonstrating that L265P is a gain-of-function driver mutation. The L265P mutant promoted cell survival by spontaneously assembling a protein complex containing IRAK1 and IRAK4, leading to IRAK4 kinase activity, IRAK1 phosphorylation, NF-κB signalling, JAK kinase activation of STAT3, and secretion of IL-6, IL-10 and interferon-β. Hence, the MYD88 signalling pathway is integral to the pathogenesis of ABC DLBCL, supporting the development of inhibitors of IRAK4 kinase and other components of this pathway for the treatment of tumours bearing oncogenic MYD88 mutations.},

Hundreds to thousands of non-driver genes undergo loss of heterozygosity (LOH) events per tumor, generating discrete differences between tumor and normal cells. Here we interrogate LOH of polymorphisms in essential genes as a novel class of therapeutic targets. We hypothesized that monoallelic inactivation of the allele retained in tumors can selectively kill cancer cells but not somatic cells, which retain both alleles. We identified 5664 variants in 1278 essential genes that undergo LOH in cancer and evaluated the potential for each to be targeted using allele-specific gene-editing, RNAi, or small-molecule approaches. We further show that allele-specific inactivation of either of two essential genes (PRIM1 and EXOSC8) reduces growth of cells harboring that allele, while cells harboring the non-targeted allele remain intact. We conclude that LOH of essential genes represents a rich class of non-driver cancer vulnerabilities.},

  abstract = {Recent advances in high-throughput technologies enable quantitative monitoring of the abundance of various biological molecules and allow determination of their variation between biological states on a genomic scale. Two popular platforms are DNA microarrays that measure messenger RNA transcript levels, and gel-free proteomic analyses that quantify protein abundance. Obviously, no single approach can fully unravel the complexities of fundamental biology and it is equally clear that integrative analysis of multiple levels of gene expression would be valuable in this endeavor. However, most integrative transcriptomic and proteomic studies have thus far either failed to find a correlation or only observed a weak correlation. In addition to various biological factors, it is suggested that the poor correlation could be quite possibly due to the inadequacy of available statistical tools to compensate for biases in the data collection methodologies. To address this issue, attempts have recently been made to systematically investigate the correlation patterns between transcriptomic and proteomic datasets, and to develop sophisticated statistical tools to improve the chances of capturing a relationship. The goal of these efforts is to enhance understanding of the relationship between transcriptomes and proteomes so that integrative analyses may be utilized to reveal new biological insights that are not accessible through one-dimensional datasets. In this review, we outline some of the challenges associated with integrative analyses and present some preliminary statistical solutions. In addition, some new applications of integrated transcriptomic and proteomic analysis to the investigation of post-transcriptional regulation are also discussed.},

These processes mark the genome, such that a cancer's life history is encrypted in the somatic mutations present. We developed algorithms to decipher this narrative and applied them to 21 breast cancers. Mutational processes evolve across a cancer's lifespan, with many emerging late but contributing extensive genetic variation. Subclonal diversification is prominent, and most mutations are found in just a fraction of tumor cells. Every tumor has a dominant subclonal lineage, representing more than 50\% of tumor cells. Minimal expansion of these subclones occurs until many hundreds to thousands of mutations have accumulated, implying the existence of long-lived, quiescent cell lineages capable of substantial proliferation upon acquisition of enabling genomic changes. Expansion of the dominant subclone to an appreciable mass may therefore represent the final rate-limiting step in a breast cancer's development, triggering diagnosis.},

We sequenced 71 mitochondrial and 7 nuclear genomes from ancient North American and Siberian dogs from time frames spanning \textasciitilde 9000 years. Our analysis indicates that American dogs were not derived from North American wolves. Instead, American dogs form a monophyletic lineage that likely originated in Siberia and dispersed into the Americas alongside people. After the arrival of Europeans, native American dogs almost completely disappeared, leaving a minimal genetic legacy in modern dog populations. The closest detectable extant lineage to precontact American dogs is the canine transmissible venereal tumor, a contagious cancer clone derived from an individual dog that lived up to 8000 years ago.},

  abstract = {Premature termination codons (PTCs) have been shown to initiate degradation of mutant transcripts through the nonsense-mediated messenger RNA (mRNA) decay (NMD) pathway. We report a strategy, termed gene identification by NMD inhibition (GINI), to identify genes harboring nonsense codons that underlie human diseases. In this strategy, the NMD pathway is pharmacologically inhibited in cultured patient cells, resulting in stabilization of nonsense transcripts. To distinguish stabilized nonsense transcripts from background transcripts upregulated by drug treatment, drug-induced expression changes are measured in control and disease cell lines with complementary DNA (cDNA) microarrays. Transcripts are ranked by a nonsense enrichment index (NEI), which relates expression changes for a given transcript in NMD-inhibited control and patient cell lines. The most promising candidates can be selected using information such as map location or biological function; however, an important advantage of the GINI strategy is that a priori information is not essential for disease gene identification. GINI was tested on colon cancer and Sandhoff disease cell lines, which contained previously characterized nonsense mutations in the MutL homolog 1 (MLH1) and hexosaminidase B (HEXB) genes, respectively. A list of genes was produced in which the MLH1 and HEXB genes were among the top 1\% of candidates, thus validating the strategy.},

  abstract = {Motivation: B cells derive their antigen-specificity through the expression of Immunoglobulin (Ig) receptors on their surface. These receptors are initially generated stochastically by somatic re-arrangement of the DNA and further diversified following antigen-activation by a process of somatic hypermutation, which introduces mainly point substitutions into the receptor DNA at a high rate. Recent advances in next-generation sequencing have enabled large-scale profiling of the B cell Ig repertoire from blood and tissue samples. A key computational challenge in the analysis of these data is partitioning the sequences to identify descendants of a common B cell (i.e. a clone). Current methods group sequences using a fixed distance threshold, or a likelihood calculation that is computationally-intensive. Here, we propose a new method based on spectral clustering with an adaptive threshold to determine the local sequence neighborhood. Validation using simulated and experimental datasets demonstrates that this method has high sensitivity and specificity compared to a fixed threshold that is optimized for these measures. In addition, this method works on datasets where choosing an optimal fixed threshold is difficult and is more computationally efficient in all cases. The ability to quickly and accurately identify members of a clone from repertoire sequencing data will greatly improve downstream analyses. Clonally-related sequences cannot be treated independently in statistical models, and clonal partitions are used as the basis for the calculation of diversity metrics, lineage reconstruction and selection analysis. Thus, the spectral clustering-based method here represents an important contribution to repertoire analysis.

  abstract = {Fc γ receptor IIB (FcγRIIB) is an inhibitory molecule capable of reducing antibody immunotherapy efficacy. We hypothesized its expression could confer resistance in patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) treated with anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody (mAb) chemoimmunotherapy, with outcomes varying depending on mAb (rituximab [R]/obinutuzumab [G]) because of different mechanisms of action. We evaluated correlates between FCGR2B messenger RNA and/or FcγRIIB protein expression and outcomes in 3 de novo DLBCL discovery cohorts treated with R plus cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (R-CHOP) reported by Arthur, Schmitz, and Reddy, and R-CHOP/G-CHOP-treated patients in the GOYA trial (NCT01287741). In the discovery cohorts, higher FCGR2B expression was associated with significantly shorter progression-free survival (PFS; Arthur: hazard ratio [HR], 1.09; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 1.01-1.19; P = .0360; Schmitz: HR, 1.13; 95\% CI, 1.02-1.26; P = .0243). Similar results were observed in GOYA with R-CHOP (HR, 1.26; 95\% CI, 1.00-1.58; P = .0455), but not G-CHOP (HR, 0.91; 95\% CI, 0.69-1.20; P = .50). A nonsignificant trend that high FCGR2B expression favored G-CHOP over R-CHOP was observed (HR, 0.67; 95\% CI, 0.44-1.02; P = .0622); however, low FCGR2B expression favored R-CHOP (HR, 1.58; 95\% CI, 1.00-2.50; P = .0503). In Arthur and GOYA, FCGR2B expression was associated with tumor FcγRIIB expression; correlating with shorter PFS for R-CHOP (HR, 2.17; 95\% CI, 1.04-4.50; P = .0378), but not G-CHOP (HR, 1.37; 95\% CI, 0.66-2.87; P = .3997). This effect was independent of established prognostic biomarkers. High FcγRIIB/FCGR2B expression has prognostic value in R-treated patients with DLBCL and may confer differential responsiveness to R-CHOP/G-CHOP.},

Although frequent gene mutations in key signaling pathways, including JAK-STAT, NOTCH and NF-κB, have also been defined, the spectrum of these mutations typically overlaps with that in the closely related diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Using a combination of discovery exome and extended targeted sequencing, we identified recurrent somatic mutations in RRAGC uniquely enriched in patients with follicular lymphoma (17\%). More than half of the mutations preferentially co-occurred with mutations in ATP6V1B2 and ATP6AP1, which encode components of the vacuolar H(+)-ATP ATPase (V-ATPase) known to be necessary for amino acid-induced activation of mTORC1. The RagC variants increased raptor binding while rendering mTORC1 signaling resistant to amino acid deprivation. The activating nature of the RRAGC mutations, their existence in the dominant clone and their stability during disease progression support their potential as an excellent candidate for therapeutic targeting.},

Genomic studies have cataloged common genetic lesions in FL such as translocation t(14;18), frequent losses of chromosome 6q, and mutations in epigenetic regulators such as EZH2 Using a focused genetic screen, we identified SESTRIN1 as a relevant target of the 6q deletion and demonstrate tumor suppression by SESTRIN1 in vivo. Moreover, SESTRIN1 is a direct target of the lymphoma-specific EZH2 gain-of-function mutation (EZH2Y641X ). SESTRIN1 inactivation disrupts p53-mediated control of mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) and enables mRNA translation under genotoxic stress. SESTRIN1 loss represents an alternative to RRAGC mutations that maintain mTORC1 activity under nutrient starvation. The antitumor efficacy of pharmacological EZH2 inhibition depends on SESTRIN1, indicating that mTORC1 control is a critical function of EZH2 in lymphoma. Conversely, EZH2Y641X mutant lymphomas show increased sensitivity to RapaLink-1, a bifunctional mTOR inhibitor. Hence, SESTRIN1 contributes to the genetic and epigenetic control of mTORC1 in lymphoma and influences responses to targeted therapies.},

Here we address the question of how the silenced mRNA can be translationally activated. We show that hnRNP K and the c-Src kinase specifically interact with each other, leading to c-Src activation and tyrosine phosphorylation of hnRNP K in vivo and in vitro. c-Src-mediated phosphorylation reversibly inhibits the binding of hnRNP K to the differentiation control element (DICE) of the LOX mRNA 3' untranslated region in vitro and specifically derepresses the translation of DICE-bearing mRNAs in vivo. Our results establish a novel role of c-Src kinase in translational gene regulation and reveal a mechanism by which silenced mRNAs can be translationally activated.},

  abstract = {Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) K is a part of the ribonucleoprotein complex which regulates diverse biological events. While overexpression of hnRNP K has been shown to be related to tumorigenesis in several cancers, both the expression patterns and biological mechanisms of hnRNP K in renal cell carcinoma (RCC) cells remain unclear. In this study, we showed that hnRNP K protein was strongly expressed in selected RCC cell lines (ACHN, A498, Caki-1, 786–0), and knock-down of hnRNP K expression by siRNA induced cell growth inhibition and apoptosis. Based on immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis of hnRNP K expression in human clear cell RCC specimens, we demonstrated that there was a significant positive correlation between hnRNP K staining score and tumor aggressiveness (e.g., Fuhrman grade, metastasis). Particularly, the rate of cytoplasmic localization of hnRNP K in primary RCC with distant metastasis was significantly higher than that in RCC without metastasis. Additionally, our results indicated that the cytoplasmic distribution of hnRNP K induced by TGF-β stimulus mainly contributed to TGF-β-triggered tumor cell invasion in RCC cells. Dominant cytoplasmic expression of ectopic hnRNP K markedly suppressed the inhibition of invasion by knock-down of endogenous hnRNP K. The expression level of matrix metalloproteinase protein-2 was decreased by endogenous hnRNP K knock-down, and restored by ectopic hnRNP K. Therefore, hnRNP K may be a key molecule involved in cell motility in RCC cells, and molecular mechanism associated with the subcellular localization of hnRNP K may be a novel target in the treatment of metastatic RCC.},

  abstract = {Hodgkin and Reed/Sternberg (HRS) cells in classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL) show constitutive activation of nuclear factor (NF)-κB. Several genetic lesions contribute to this deregulated NF-κB activity. Here, we analysed two further NF-κB regulators for genetic lesions, the inhibitory factor TRAF3 and the key signalling component of the alternative NF-κB pathway, MAP3K14 (NIK). Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array analysis of cHL cell lines revealed a uniparental disomy of the long arm of chromosome 14 associated with a biallelic deletion of TRAF3 located on this chromosome in cell line U-HO1. Cloning of the deletion breakpoint showed a 123~371 bp deletion. No inactivating mutations of TRAF3 were found in six other cHL cell lines or in microdissected HRS cells from seven cHL. However, in primary cHL samples interphase cytogenetic analyses revealed signal patterns indicating monoallelic deletion of TRAF3 in 3/20 other cases. SNP array analysis revealed a gain of copy number for MAP3K14 in three cHL cell lines. Gains of MAP3K14 were detected in 5/16 cases of primary cHL. In conclusion, in rare instances, HRS cells harbour inactivating mutations of the TRAF3 gene and recurrently show gains of MAP3K14, indicating that more components of NF-κB signalling show genetic lesions in HRS cells than previously known.},

  abstract = {Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) is an uncommon B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) that is incurable with standard therapies. The genetic drivers of this cancer have not been firmly established, and the features that contribute to differences in clinical course remain limited. To extend our understanding of the biological pathways involved in this malignancy, we performed a large-scale genomic analysis of MCL using data from 51 exomes and 34 genomes alongside previously published exome cohorts. To confirm our findings, we resequenced the genes identified in the exome cohort in 191 MCL tumors, each having clinical follow-up data. We confirmed the prognostic association of TP53 and NOTCH1 mutations. Our sequencing revealed novel recurrent noncoding mutations surrounding a single exon of the HNRNPH1gene. In RNA-seq data from 103 of these cases, MCL tumors with these mutations had a distinct imbalance of HNRNPH1 isoforms. This altered splicing of HNRNPH1 was associated with inferior outcomes in MCL and showed a significant increase in protein expression by immunohistochemistry. We describe a functional role for these recurrent noncoding mutations in disrupting an autoregulatory feedback mechanism, thereby deregulating HNRNPH1 protein expression. Taken together, these data strongly imply a role for aberrant regulation of messenger RNA processing in MCL pathobiology.},

Although the function of hnRNP A2B1 in the nucleus is primarily known, the level of hnRNP A2B1 in the cytoplasm was increased in LPS-stimulated 38B9 cells, while it was not detected in the cytoplasm of non-treated 38B9 cells. The silencing of hnRNP A2B1 expression using siRNA disturbed B cell maturation by regulation of mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling, NF-κB activation, and protein kinase B activation. These results suggest that hnRNP A2B1 is associated with MHC class II molecules and is involved in B cell activation signaling pathways in LPS-stimulated 38B9 cells.},

  abstract = {The pathogenesis of splenic marginal zone lymphoma (SMZL) remains largely unknown. Recent high-throughput sequencing studies have identified recurrent mutations in key pathways, most notably NOTCH2 mutations in {$>$}25\% of patients. These studies are based on small, heterogeneous discovery cohorts, and therefore only captured a fraction of the lesions present in the SMZL genome. To identify further novel pathogenic mutations within related biochemical pathways, we applied whole exome sequencing (WES) and copy number (CN) analysis to a biologically and clinically homogeneous cohort of seven SMZL patients with 7q abnormalities and IGHV1-2*04 gene usage. We identified 173 somatic non-silent variants, affecting 160 distinct genes. In additional to providing independent validation of the presence of mutation in several previously reported genes (NOTCH2, TNFAIP3, MAP3K14, MLL2 and SPEN), our study defined eight additional recurrently mutated genes in SMZL; these genes are CREBBP, CBFA2T3, AMOTL1, FAT4, FBXO11, PLA2G4D, TRRAP and USH2A. By integrating our WES and CN data we identified three mutated putative candidate genes targeted by 7q deletions (CUL1, EZH2 and FLNC), with FLNC positioned within the well-characterized 7q minimally deleted region. Taken together, this work expands the reported directory of recurrently mutated cancer genes in this disease, thereby expanding our understanding of SMZL pathogenesis. Ultimately, this work will help to establish a stratified approach to care including the possibility of targeted therapy.},

By combining next-generation sequencing and copy number analysis, we show that the DLBCL coding genome contains, on average, more than 30 clonally represented gene alterations per case. This analysis also revealed mutations in genes not previously implicated in DLBCL pathogenesis, including those regulating chromatin methylation (MLL2; 24\% of samples) and immune recognition by T cells. These results provide initial data on the complexity of the DLBCL coding genome and identify novel dysregulated pathways underlying its pathogenesis.},

Although B-cell lymphomas are associated with chromosomal translocations that deregulate oncogene expression, a mechanism for genome-wide instability during lymphomagenesis has not been described. During B-cell development, the immunoglobulin variable (V) region genes are subject to somatic hypermutation in germinal-centre B cells. Here we report that an aberrant hypermutation activity targets multiple loci, including the proto-oncogenes PIM1, MYC, RhoH/TTF (ARHH) and PAX5, in more than 50\% of diffuse large-cell lymphomas (DLCLs), which are tumours derived from germinal centres. Mutations are distributed in the 5' untranslated or coding sequences, are independent of chromosomal translocations, and share features typical of V-region-associated somatic hypermutation. In contrast to mutations in V regions, however, these mutations are not detectable in normal germinal-centre B cells or in other germinal-centre-derived lymphomas, suggesting a DLCL-associated malfunction of somatic hypermutation. Intriguingly, the four hypermutable genes are susceptible to chromosomal translocations in the same region, consistent with a role for hypermutation in generating translocations by DNA double-strand breaks. By mutating multiple genes, and possibly by favouring chromosomal translocations, aberrant hypermutation may represent the major contributor to lymphomagenesis.},

Overall, about 39\% of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and 41\% of follicular lymphoma cases display genomic deletions and/or somatic mutations that remove or inactivate the HAT coding domain of these two genes. These lesions usually affect one allele, suggesting that reduction in HAT dosage is important for lymphomagenesis. We demonstrate specific defects in acetylation-mediated inactivation of the BCL6 oncoprotein and activation of the p53 tumour suppressor. These results identify CREBBP/EP300 mutations as a major pathogenetic mechanism shared by common forms of B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, with direct implications for the use of drugs targeting acetylation/deacetylation mechanisms.},

For human B-cell subsets, the functional relationships among BCL-2 members are unclear, and also if and how they shift after malignant transformation. We here dissect these aspects in human tonsil and primary leukemia (CLL) cells by single and combined treatment with novel, highly specific BH3-mimetics. We found that MCL-1 expression in GC B-cells is regulated post-translationally and its importance is highlighted by preferential binding to pro-apoptotic BIM. In contrast, BCL-XL is transcriptionally induced and binds solely to weak sensitizer BIK, potentially explaining why BCL-XL is not required for GC B-cell survival. Using novel BH3-mimetics, we found that naive and memory B-cells depend on BCL-2, GC cells predominantly on MCL-1, whereas plasma cells need both BCL-XL and MCL-1 for survival. CLL cells switch from highly sensitive for BCL-2 inhibition to resistant after CD40-stimulation. However, combined inhibition of BCL-2, plus BCL-XL or MCL-1 effectively kills these cells, thus exposing a weakness that may be therapeutically useful. These general principles offer important clues for designing treatment strategies for B-cell malignancies.},

NMD eliminates aberrant mRNA species derived from sources of genetic variation such as gene mutations, alternative splicing and DNA rearrangements in immune cells. In addition, recent data suggest that NMD is an important mechanism of global gene expression regulation. Here, we describe new reporters to quantify NMD activity at the single cell level using fluorescent proteins of two colors: green TagGFP2 and far-red Katushka. TagGFP2 was encoded by mRNA targeted to either the splicing-dependent or the long 3'UTR-dependent NMD pathway. Katushka was used as an expression level control. Comparison of the fluorescence intensities of cells expressing these reporters and cells expressing TagGFP2 and Katushka from corresponding control NMD-independent vectors allowed for the assessment of NMD activity at the single cell level using fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry. The proposed reporter system was successfully tested in several mammalian cell lines and in transgenic Xenopus embryos.},

To understand the mechanisms behind this process, we transfected endothelial cells with miR-503 carrying a biotin tag. Then, we pulled-down the proteins interacting with miR-503 and studied their role in microRNA exosomal export. A total of four different binding partners were identified by mass spectrometry and validated by western blotting and negative controls, among them ANXA2 and hnRNPA2B1. Using knock-down systems combined with pull-down analysis, we determined that epirubicin mediates the export of miR-503 by disrupting the interaction between hnRNPA2B1 and miR-503. Then, both ANXA2 and miR-503 are sorted into exosomes while hnRNPA2B1 is relocated into the nucleus. The combination of these processes culminates in the increased export of miR-503. These results suggest, for the first time, that RNA-binding proteins can negatively regulate the exosomal sorting of microRNAs.},

  abstract = {Nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) is a eukaryotic mRNA surveillance system that selectively degrades transcripts with premature termination codons (PTC). Many RNA-binding proteins (RBP) regulate their expression levels by a negative feedback loop, in which RBP binds its own pre-mRNA and causes alternative splicing to introduce a PTC. We present a bioinformatic analysis integrating three data sources, eCLIP assays for a large RBP panel, shRNA inactivation of NMD pathway, and shRNA-depletion of RBPs followed by RNA-seq, to identify novel such autoregulatory feedback loops. We show that RBPs frequently bind their own pre-mRNAs, their exons respond prominently to NMD pathway disruption, and that the responding exons are enriched with nearby eCLIP peaks. We confirm previously proposed models of autoregulation in SRSF7 and U2AF1 genes and present two novel models, in which (i) SFPQ binds its mRNA and promotes switching to an alternative distal 3'-UTR that is targeted by NMD, and (ii) RPS3 binding activates a poison 5'-splice site in its pre-mRNA that leads to a frame shift and degradation by NMD. We also suggest specific splicing events that could be implicated in autoregulatory feedback loops in RBM39, HNRNPM, and U2AF2 genes.

Commercially available fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) probe sets, including IGH/MYC dual-color dual-fusion (D-FISH) and MYC break-apart probes (BAPs), serve as the primary methodology utilized to detect MYC rearrangements. However, performing either IGH/MYC D-FISH or MYC BAP FISH studies in isolation has been reported to result in false-negative results because of the complex nature of 8q24 rearrangements involving the MYC gene region. We report a 60-yr-old male with newly diagnosed high-grade B-cell lymphoma with a negative MYC BAP study, but with positive BCL2 and BCL6 BAP studies. Per our current laboratory algorithm to concurrently interrogate the MYC gene region with both MYC BAP and IGH/MYC D-FISH probe sets, we performed IGH/MYC D-FISH studies and detected an IGH/MYC fusion. To further characterize the discrepant MYC results obtained by FISH, a next-generation sequencing strategy, mate-pair sequencing (MPseq), was performed and revealed a small insertion (∼200 kb) of the IGH locus downstream from the MYC gene that was undetectable by MYC BAP studies. This case highlights the importance of utilizing both IGH/MYC D-FISH and MYC BAP sets to detect potential cryptic MYC rearrangements and also demonstrates the power of MPseq to characterize complex structural rearrangements and copy-number abnormalities unappreciable by FISH.},

HnRNP proteins have been localized to the nucleoplasm and their functions were presumed to be limited to nuclear events in mRNA biogenesis. It was proposed that an exchange of hnRNP for mRNA-binding proteins accompanies transport of mRNA from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. We show here that several of the abundant hnRNP proteins, including A1, shuttle between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. HnRNP proteins may thus also have cytoplasmic functions. Furthermore, when in the cytoplasm, A1 is bound to mRNA and RNA polymerase II transcription is necessary before it can return to the nucleus. We propose that the cytoplasmic ribonucleoprotein complex of mRNA with hnRNP proteins is the substrate of nuclear-cytoplasmic transport of mRNA.},

We apply Cicero to investigate how dynamically accessible elements orchestrate gene regulation in differentiating myoblasts. Groups of Cicero-linked regulatory elements meet criteria of "chromatin hubs"-they are enriched for physical proximity, interact with a common set of transcription factors, and undergo coordinated changes in histone marks that are predictive of changes in gene expression. Pseudotemporal analysis revealed that most DNA elements remain in chromatin hubs throughout differentiation. A subset of elements bound by MYOD1 in myoblasts exhibit early opening in a PBX1- and MEIS1-dependent manner.

Errors in lung cancer type or malignant growth determination lead to degraded treatment efficacy, because anticancer strategy depends on tumor morphology. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We have made an attempt to evaluate effectiveness of machine learning algorithms in the task of lung cancer classification based on gene expression levels. We processed four publicly available data sets. The Dana-Farber Cancer Institute data set contains 203 samples and the task was to classify four cancer types and sound tissue samples. With the University of Michigan data set of 96 samples, the task was to execute a binary classification of adenocarcinoma and non-neoplastic tissues. The University of Toronto data set contains 39 samples and the task was to detect recurrence, while with the Brigham and Women's Hospital data set of 181 samples it was to make a binary classification of malignant pleural mesothelioma and adenocarcinoma. We used the k-nearest neighbor algorithm (k=1, k=5, k=10), naive Bayes classifier with assumption of both a normal distribution of attributes and a distribution through histograms, support vector machine and C4.5 decision tree. Effectiveness of machine learning algorithms was evaluated with the Matthews correlation coefficient. RESULTS: The support vector machine method showed best results among data sets from the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Brigham and Women's Hospital. All algorithms with the exception of the C4.5 decision tree showed maximum potential effectiveness in the University of Michigan data set. However, the C4.5 decision tree showed best results for the University of Toronto data set. CONCLUSIONS: Machine learning algorithms can be used for lung cancer morphology classification and similar tasks based on gene expression level evaluation.},

We found 1,246 somatic mutations potentially affecting gene function and identified 78 genes with predicted functional alterations in more than one tumor sample. Among these genes, SF3B1, encoding a subunit of the spliceosomal U2 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP), is somatically mutated in 9.7\% of affected individuals. Further analysis in 279 individuals with CLL showed that SF3B1 mutations were associated with faster disease progression and poor overall survival. This work provides the first comprehensive catalog of somatic mutations in CLL with relevant clinical correlates and defines a large set of new genes that may drive the development of this common form of leukemia. The results reinforce the idea that targeting several well-known genetic pathways, including mRNA splicing, could be useful in the treatment of CLL and other malignancies.},

  abstract = {Fcγ receptors are a family of cell–surface receptors that are expressed by a host of different innate and adaptive immune cells, and mediate inflammatory responses by binding the Fc portion of immunoglobulin G. In humans, five low-affinity receptors are encoded by the genes FCGR2A, FCGR2B, FCGR2C, FCGR3A, and FCGR3B, which are located in an 82.5-kb segmental tandem duplication on chromosome 1q23.3, which shows extensive copy-number variation (CNV). Deletions of FCGR3B have been suggested to increase the risk of inflammatory diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis (RA). In this study, we identify the deletion breakpoints of FCGR3B deletion alleles in the UK population and endogamous native American population, and show that some but not all alleles are likely to be identical-by-descent. We also localize a duplication breakpoint, confirming that the mechanism of CNV generation is nonallelic homologous recombination, and identify several alleles with gene conversion events using fosmid sequencing data. We use information on the structure of the deletion alleles to distinguish FCGR3B deletions from FCGR3A deletions in whole-genome array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) data. Reanalysis of published aCGH data using this approach supports association of FCGR3B deletion with increased risk of RA in a large cohort of 1,982 cases and 3,271 controls (odds ratio 1.61, P = 2.9×10−3).}

  abstract = {The 5' m7G cap is an evolutionarily conserved modification of eukaryotic mRNA. Decades of research have established that the m7G cap serves as a unique molecular module that recruits cellular proteins and mediates cap-related biological functions such as pre-mRNA processing, nuclear export and cap-dependent protein synthesis. Only recently has the role of the cap 2'O methylation as an identifier of self RNA in the innate immune system against foreign RNA has become clear. The discovery of the cytoplasmic capping machinery suggests a novel level of control network. These new findings underscore the importance of a proper cap structure in the synthesis of functional messenger RNA. In this review, we will summarize the current knowledge of the biological roles of mRNA caps in eukaryotic cells. We will also discuss different means that viruses and their host cells use to cap their RNA and the application of these capping machineries to synthesize functional mRNA. Novel applications of RNA capping enzymes in the discovery of new RNA species and sequencing the microbiome transcriptome will also be discussed. We will end with a summary of novel findings in RNA capping and the questions these findings pose.},

Low kinase activity of A-Raf toward MEK suggested that A-Raf might have alternative functions. Here, we show that A-Raf prevents cancer cell apoptosis contingent on the expression of the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein H (hnRNP H) splice factor, which is required for the correct transcription and expression of a-raf. Apoptosis was prevented by A-Raf through sequestration and inactivation of the proapoptotic MST2 kinase. Small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of hnRNP H or A-Raf resulted in MST2-dependent apoptosis. In contrast, enforced expression of either hnRNP H or A-Raf partially counteracted apoptosis induced by etoposide. In vivo expression studies of colon specimens corroborated the overexpression of hnRNP H in malignant tissues and its correlation with A-Raf levels. Our findings define a novel mechanism that is usurped in tumor cells to escape naturally imposed apoptotic signals.},

  abstract = {Background Adult T-cell leukemia lymphoma (ATLL) is a chemotherapy-resistant malignancy with a median survival of less than one year that will afflict between one hundred thousand and one million individuals worldwide who are currently infected with human T-cell leukemia virus type 1. Recurrent somatic mutations in host genes have exposed the T-cell receptor pathway through nuclear factor κB to interferon regulatory factor 4 (IRF4) as an essential driver for this malignancy. We sought to determine if IRF4 represents a therapeutic target for ATLL and to identify downstream effectors and biomarkers of IRF4 signaling in vivo. Results ATLL cell lines, particularly Tax viral oncoprotein-negative cell lines, that most closely resemble ATLL in humans, were sensitive to dose- and time-dependent inhibition by a next-generation class of IRF4 antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) that employ constrained ethyl residues that mediate RNase H-dependent RNA degradation. ATLL cell lines were also sensitive to lenalidomide, which repressed IRF4 expression. Both ASOs and lenalidomide inhibited ATLL proliferation in vitro and in vivo. To identify biomarkers of IRF4-mediated CD4\,+\,T-cell expansion in vivo, transcriptomic analysis identified several genes that encode key regulators of ATLL, including interleukin 2 receptor subunits α and β, KIT ligand, cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4, and thymocyte selection-associated high mobility group protein TOX 2. Conclusions These data support the pursuit of IRF4 as a therapeutic target in ATLL with the use of either ASOs or lenalidomide.},

  abstract = {Rituximab, a type I anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody (mAb), induces incomplete B cell depletion in some patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), thus contributing to a poor clinical response. The mechanisms of this resistance remain elusive. The purpose of this study was to determine whether type II mAb are more efficient than type I mAb at depleting B cells from RA and SLE patients, whether internalization influences the efficiency of depletion, and whether Fcγ receptor type IIb (FcγRIIb) and the B cell receptor regulate this internalization process. We used an in vitro whole blood B cell–depletion assay to assess the efficiency of depletion, flow cytometry to study cell surface protein expression, and surface fluorescence–quenching assays to assess rituximab internalization, in samples from patients with RA and patients with SLE. Paired t-test or Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare groups, and Spearman's rank correlation test was used to assess correlation. We found that type II mAb internalized significantly less rituximab than type I mAb and depleted B cells from patients with RA and SLE at least 2-fold more efficiently than type I mAb. Internalization of rituximab was highly variable between patients, was regulated by FcγRIIb, and inversely correlated with cytotoxicity in whole blood B cell–depletion assays. The lowest levels of internalization were seen in IgD– B cells, including postswitched (IgD–CD27+) memory cells. Internalization of type I anti-CD20 mAb was also partially inhibited by anti-IgM stimulation. Variability in internalization of rituximab was observed and was correlated with impaired B cell depletion. Therefore, slower-internalizing type II mAb should be considered as alternative B cell–depleting agents for the treatment of RA and SLE.}

  abstract = {Classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL) is characterized by sparsely distributed Hodgkin and Reed-Sternberg (HRS) cells amid reactive host background, complicating the acquisition of neoplastic DNA without extensive background contamination. We overcame this limitation by using flow-sorted HRS and intratumor T cells and optimized low-input exome sequencing of 10 patient samples to reveal alterations in genes involved in antigen presentation, chromosome integrity, transcriptional regulation, and ubiquitination. β-2-microglobulin (B2M) is the most commonly altered gene in HRS cells, with 7 of 10 cases having inactivating mutations that lead to loss of major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) expression. Enforced wild-type B2M expression in a cHL cell line restored MHC-I expression. In an extended cohort of 145 patients, the absence of B2M protein in the HRS cells was associated with lower stage of disease, younger age at diagnosis, and better overall and progression-free survival. B2M-deficient cases encompassed most of the nodular sclerosis subtype cases and only a minority of mixed cellularity cases, suggesting that B2M deficiency determines the tumor microenvironment and may define a major subset of cHL that has more uniform clinical and morphologic features. In addition, we report previously unknown genetic alterations that may render selected patients sensitive to specific targeted therapies.},

  abstract = {Burkitt lymphoma is a mature aggressive B-cell lymphoma derived from germinal center B cells. Its cytogenetic hallmark is the Burkitt translocation t(8;14)(q24;q32) and its variants, which juxtapose the MYC oncogene with one of the three immunoglobulin loci. Consequently, MYC is deregulated, resulting in massive perturbation of gene expression. Nevertheless, MYC deregulation alone seems not to be sufficient to drive Burkitt lymphomagenesis. By whole-genome, whole-exome and transcriptome sequencing of four prototypical Burkitt lymphomas with immunoglobulin gene (IG)-MYC translocation, we identified seven recurrently mutated genes. One of these genes, ID3, mapped to a region of focal homozygous loss in Burkitt lymphoma. In an extended cohort, 36 of 53 molecularly defined Burkitt lymphomas (68\%) carried potentially damaging mutations of ID3. These were strongly enriched at somatic hypermutation motifs. Only 6 of 47 other B-cell lymphomas with the IG-MYC translocation (13\%) carried ID3 mutations. These findings suggest that cooperation between ID3 inactivation and IG-MYC translocation is a hallmark of Burkitt lymphomagenesis.},

  abstract = {Classification of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) into cell-of-origin (COO) subtypes based on gene expression profiles has well-established prognostic value. These subtypes, termed germinal center B cell (GCB) and activated B cell (ABC) also have different genetic alterations and overexpression of different pathways that may serve as therapeutic targets. Thus, accurate classification is essential for analysis of clinical trial results and planning new trials by using targeted agents. The current standard for COO classification uses gene expression profiling (GEP) of snap frozen tissues, and a Bayesian predictor algorithm. However, this is generally not feasible. In this study, we investigated whether the qNPA technique could be used for accurate classification of COO by using formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues. We analyzed expression levels of 14 genes in 121 cases of R-CHOP-treated DLBCL that had previously undergone GEP by using the Affymetrix U133 Plus 2.0 microarray and had matching FFPE blocks. Results were evaluated by using the previously published algorithm with a leave-one-out cross-validation approach. These results were compared with COO classification based on frozen tissue GEP profiles. For each case, a probability statistic was generated indicating the likelihood that the classification by using qNPA was accurate. When data were dichotomized into GCB or non-GCB, overall accuracy was 92\%. The qNPA technique accurately categorized DLBCL into GCB and ABC subtypes, as defined by GEP. This approach is quantifiable, applicable to FFPE tissues with no technical failures, and has potential for significant impact on DLBCL research and clinical trial development.},

  abstract = {limma is an R/Bioconductor software package that provides an integrated solution for analysing data from gene expression experiments. It contains rich features for handling complex experimental designs and for information borrowing to overcome the problem of small sample sizes. Over the past decade, limma has been a popular choice for gene discovery through differential expression analyses of microarray and high-throughput PCR data. The package contains particularly strong facilities for reading, normalizing and exploring such data. Recently, the capabilities of limma have been significantly expanded in two important directions. First, the package can now perform both differential expression and differential splicing analyses of RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data. All the downstream analysis tools previously restricted to microarray data are now available for RNA-seq as well. These capabilities allow users to analyse both RNA-seq and microarray data with very similar pipelines. Second, the package is now able to go past the traditional gene-wise expression analyses in a variety of ways, analysing expression profiles in terms of co-regulated sets of genes or in terms of higher-order expression signatures. This provides enhanced possibilities for biological interpretation of gene expression differences. This article reviews the philosophy and design of the limma package, summarizing both new and historical features, with an emphasis on recent enhancements and features that have not been previously described.}

Here, we show that MedB-1 PMBL-derived and L1236 Hodgkin-derived cell lines and 20 of 55 (36\%) PMBL cases harbor heterozygous missense mutations in STAT6 DNA binding domain, whereas no mutation was found in 25 diffuse large B-cell lymphoma samples. In 3 cases, somatic origin was indicated by the absence of the mutations in the nontumoral tissue. The pattern of STAT6 mutations was different from the classical features of somatic hypermutations. The mutant STAT6 proteins showed a decreased DNA binding ability in transfected HEK cells, but no decrease in expression of STAT6 canonical target genes was observed in PMBL cases with a mutated STAT6 gene. Although the oncogenic properties of STAT6 mutant proteins remain to be determined, their recurrent selection in PMBL strongly argues for their involvement in the pathogenesis of this aggressive B-cell lymphoma.},

We performed transcriptome and whole genome sequencing on 15 cases of Ph-like ALL, and identified rearrangements involving ABL1, JAK2, PDGFRB, CRLF2 and EPOR, activating mutations of IL7R and FLT3, and deletion of SH2B3, which encodes the JAK2 negative regulator LNK. Importantly, several of these alterations induce transformation that is attenuated with tyrosine kinase inhibitors, suggesting the treatment outcome of these patients may be improved with targeted therapy.},

  abstract = {Therapeutic antibodies have transformed cancer therapy, unlocking mechanisms of action by engaging the immune system. Unfortunately, cures rarely occur and patients display intrinsic or acquired resistance. Here, we demonstrate the therapeutic potential of targeting human (h) FcγRIIB (CD32B), a receptor implicated in immune cell desensitization and tumor cell resistance. FcγRIIB-blocking antibodies prevented internalization of the CD20-specific antibody rituximab, thereby maximizing cell surface accessibility and immune effector cell mediated antitumor activity. In hFcγRIIB-transgenic (Tg) mice, FcγRIIB-blocking antibodies effectively deleted target cells in combination with rituximab, and other therapeutic antibodies, from resistance-prone stromal compartments. Similar efficacy was seen in primary human tumor xenografts, including with cells from patients with relapsed/refractory disease. These data support the further development of hFcγRIIB antibodies for clinical assessment.}

We used gene expression profiling to develop a more precise molecular diagnosis of PMBL. PMBL patients were considerably younger than other DLBCL patients, and their lymphomas frequently involved other thoracic structures but not extrathoracic sites typical of other DLBCLs. PMBL patients had a relatively favorable clinical outcome, with a 5-yr survival rate of 64\% compared with 46\% for other DLBCL patients. Gene expression profiling strongly supported a relationship between PMBL and Hodgkin lymphoma: over one third of the genes that were more highly expressed in PMBL than in other DLBCLs were also characteristically expressed in Hodgkin lymphoma cells. PDL2, which encodes a regulator of T cell activation, was the gene that best discriminated PMBL from other DLBCLs and was also highly expressed in Hodgkin lymphoma cells. The genomic loci for PDL2 and several neighboring genes were amplified in over half of the PMBLs and in Hodgkin lymphoma cell lines. The molecular diagnosis of PMBL should significantly aid in the development of therapies tailored to this clinically and pathogenetically distinctive subgroup of DLBCL.},

  abstract = {We recently characterized human hnRNP L as a global regulator of alternative splicing, binding to CA-repeat and CA-rich elements. Here we report that hnRNP L autoregulates its own expression on the level of alternative splicing. Intron 6 of the human hnRNP L gene contains a short exon that, if used, introduces a premature termination codon, resulting in nonsense-mediated decay (NMD). This “poison exon” is preceded by a highly conserved CA-rich cluster extending over 800 nucleotides that binds hnRNP L and functions as an unusually extended, intronic enhancer, promoting inclusion of the poison exon. As a result, excess hnRNP L activates NMD of its own mRNA, thereby creating a negative autoregulatory feedback loop and contributing to homeostasis of hnRNP L levels. We present experimental evidence for this mechanism, based on NMD inactivation, hnRNP L binding assays, and hnRNP L-dependent alternative splicing of heterologous constructs. In addition, we demonstrate that hnRNP L cross-regulates inclusion of an analogous poison exon in the hnRNP L-like pre-mRNA, which explains the reciprocal expression of the two closely related hnRNP L proteins.},

Detection of active NF-κB signaling in 14 (58\%) of 24 SMZLs prompted the investigation of NF-κB molecular alterations in 101 SMZLs. Mutations and copy number abnormalities of NF-κB genes occurred in 36 (36\%) of 101 SMZLs and targeted both canonical (TNFAIP3 and IKBKB) and noncanonical (BIRC3, TRAF3, MAP3K14) NF-κB pathways. Most alterations were mutually exclusive, documenting the existence of multiple independent mechanisms affecting NF-κB in SMZL. BIRC3 inactivation in SMZL recurred because of somatic mutations that disrupted the same RING domain that in extranodal marginal zone lymphoma is removed by the t(11;18) translocation, which points to BIRC3 disruption as a common mechanism across marginal zone B-cell lymphomagenesis. Genetic lesions of NF-κB provide a molecular basis for the pathogenesis of more than 30\% of SMZLs and offer a suitable target for NF-κB therapeutic approaches in this lymphoma.},

By integrating whole-exome sequencing and copy-number analysis, we show that the SMZL exome carries at least 30 nonsilent gene alterations. Mutations in NOTCH2, a gene required for marginal-zone (MZ) B cell development, represent the most frequent lesion in SMZL, accounting for ∼20\% of cases. All NOTCH2 mutations are predicted to cause impaired degradation of the NOTCH2 protein by eliminating the C-terminal PEST domain, which is required for proteasomal recruitment. Among indolent B cell lymphoproliferative disorders, NOTCH2 mutations are restricted to SMZL, thus representing a potential diagnostic marker for this lymphoma type. In addition to NOTCH2, other modulators or members of the NOTCH pathway are recurrently targeted by genetic lesions in SMZL; these include NOTCH1, SPEN, and DTX1. We also noted mutations in other signaling pathways normally involved in MZ B cell development, suggesting that deregulation of MZ B cell development pathways plays a role in the pathogenesis of ∼60\% SMZL. These findings have direct implications for the treatment of SMZL patients, given the availability of drugs that can target NOTCH, NF-κB, and other pathways deregulated in this disease.},

We have recently identified a regulated ESS within variable exon 4 of the CD45 gene, named ESS1, that is necessary and sufficient for partial exon repression in resting T cells and has additional silencing activity upon T-cell activation. In this study, we identify three heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs) that bind specifically to ESS1. The binding of one of these proteins, hnRNP-L, is significantly decreased by mutations that disrupt both the basal and induced activities of ESS1. Recombinant hnRNP-L functions to repress exon inclusion in vitro in an ESS1-dependent manner. Moreover, depletion of hnRNP-L, either in vitro or in vivo, leads to increased exon inclusion. In contrast, the other ESS1-binding proteins, PTB and hnRNP E2, do not discriminate between wild-type and mutant ESS1 in binding studies, and do not specifically alter ESS1-dependent splicing in vitro. Together, these studies demonstrate that hnRNP-L is the primary protein through which CD45 exon 4 silencing is mediated by the regulatory sequence ESS1.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: The (14;18) translocation constitutes both a genetic hallmark and critical early event in the natural history of follicular lymphoma (FL). However, t(14;18) is also detectable in the blood of otherwise healthy persons, and its relationship with progression to disease remains unclear. Here we sought to determine whether t(14;18)-positive cells in healthy individuals represent tumor precursors and whether their detection could be used as an early predictor for FL. PARTICIPANTS AND METHODS: Among 520,000 healthy participants enrolled onto the EPIC (European Prospective Investigation Into Cancer and Nutrition) cohort, we identified 100 who developed FL 2 to 161 months after enrollment. Prediagnostic blood from these and 218 controls were screened for t(14;18) using sensitive polymerase chain reaction-based assays. Results were subsequently validated in an independent cohort (65 case participants; 128 controls). Clonal relationships between t(14;18) cells and FL were also assessed by molecular backtracking of paired prediagnostic blood and tumor samples. RESULTS: Clonal analysis of t(14;18) junctions in paired prediagnostic blood versus tumor samples demonstrated that progression to FL occurred from t(14;18)-positive committed precursors. Furthermore, healthy participants at enrollment who developed FL up to 15 years later showed a markedly higher t(14;18) prevalence and frequency than controls (P {$<$} .001). Altogether, we estimated a 23-fold higher risk of subsequent FL in blood samples associated with a frequency {$>$} 10(-4) (odds ratio, 23.17; 95\% CI, 9.98 to 67.31; P {$<$} .001). Remarkably, risk estimates remained high and significant up to 15 years before diagnosis. CONCLUSION: High t(14;18) frequency in blood from healthy individuals defines the first predictive biomarker for FL, effective years before diagnosis.},

  abstract = {Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) patients are typically treated with immunochemotherapy containing rituximab (rituximab, cyclophosphamide, hydroxydaunorubicin-vincristine (Oncovin), and prednisone [R-CHOP]); however, prognosis is extremely poor if R-CHOP fails. To identify genetic mechanisms contributing to primary or acquired R-CHOP resistance, we performed target-panel sequencing of 135 relapsed/refractory DLBCLs (rrDLBCLs), primarily comprising circulating tumor DNA from patients on clinical trials. Comparison with a metacohort of 1670 diagnostic DLBCLs identified 6 genes significantly enriched for mutations upon relapse. TP53 and KMT2D were mutated in the majority of rrDLBCLs, and these mutations remained clonally persistent throughout treatment in paired diagnostic-relapse samples, suggesting a role in primary treatment resistance. Nonsense and missense mutations affecting MS4A1, which encodes CD20, are exceedingly rare in diagnostic samples but show recurrent patterns of clonal expansion following rituximab-based therapy. MS4A1 missense mutations within the transmembrane domains lead to loss of CD20 in vitro, and patient tumors harboring these mutations lacked CD20 protein expression. In a time series from a patient treated with multiple rounds of therapy, tumor heterogeneity and minor MS4A1-harboring subclones contributed to rapid disease recurrence, with MS4A1 mutations as founding events for these subclones. TP53 and KMT2D mutation status, in combination with other prognostic factors, may be used to identify high-risk patients prior to R-CHOP for posttreatment monitoring. Using liquid biopsies, we show the potential to identify tumors with loss of CD20 surface expression stemming from MS4A1 mutations. Implementation of noninvasive assays to detect such features of acquired treatment resistance may allow timely transition to more effective treatment regimens.},

  abstract = {By generating mRNA containing a premature termination codon (PTC), alternative splicing (AS) can quantitatively regulate the expression of genes that are degraded by nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD). We previously demonstrated that AS-induced retention of part of intron 3 of rpL3 pre-mRNA produces an mRNA isoform that contains a PTC and is targeted for decay by NMD. We also demonstrated that overexpression of rpL3 downregulates canonical splicing and upregulates the alternative splicing of its pre-mRNA. We are currently investigating the molecular mechanism underlying rpL3 autoregulation. Here we report that the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) H1 is a transacting factor able to interact in vitro and in vivo with rpL3 and with intron 3 of the rpL3 gene. We investigated the role played by hnRNP H1 in the regulation of splicing of rpL3 pre-mRNA by manipulating its expression level. Depletion of hnRNP H1 reduced the level of the PTC-containing mRNA isoform, whereas its overexpression favored the selection of the cryptic 3′ splice site of intron 3. We also identified and characterized the cis-acting regulatory elements involved in hnRNP H1-mediated regulation of splicing. RNA electromobility shift assay demonstrated that hnRNP H1 specifically recognizes and binds directly to the intron 3 region that contains seven copies of G-rich elements. Site-directed mutagenesis analysis and in vivo studies showed that the G3 and G6 elements are required for hnRNP H1-mediated regulation of rpL3 pre-mRNA splicing. We propose a working model in which rpL3 recruits hnRNP H1 and, through cooperation with other splicing factors, promotes selection of the alternative splice site.},

  abstract = {Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a common and aggressive hematological malignancy. Acquisition of heterogeneous genetic aberrations and epigenetic dysregulation lead to the transformation of hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) into leukemic stem cells (LSC), which subsequently gives rise to immature blast cells and a leukemic phenotype. LSCs are responsible for disease relapse as current chemotherapeutic regimens are not able to completely eradicate these cellular sub-populations. Therefore, it is critical to improve upon the existing knowledge of LSC specific markers, which would allow for specific targeting of these cells more effectively. Although significant milestones in decoding the aberrant transcriptional network of various cancers, including leukemia, have been achieved, studies on the involvement of post-transcriptional gene regulation (PTGR) in disease progression are beginning to unfold. RNA binding proteins (RBPs), are key players in mediating PTGR and they regulate the intracellular fate of individual transcripts, from their biogenesis to RNA metabolism. In this study, we have used an integrative approach to systematically profile RBP expression and identify key regulatory RBPs involved in normal myeloid development and AML. We have analyzed RNA-seq datasets (GSE74246) of HSCs, common myeloid progenitors (CMPs), granulocyte-macrophage progenitors (GMPs), monocytes, LSCs, and blasts. We observed that normal and leukemic cells can be distinguished on the basis of RBP expression, which is indicative of cell type specific expression. We identified that distinctly co-expressing modules of RBPs and their subclasses were enriched in hematopoietic stem/progenitor (HSCP) and differentiated monocytes. We detected expression of DZIP3, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, in HSCP, knockdown of which promotes monocytic differentiation in cell line model. We identified co-expression modules of RBP genes in LSCs and among these, distinct modules of RBP genes with high and low expression. The expression of several AML-specific RBPs were validated byqRT-PCR. Network analysis identified densely connected hubs of ribosomal RBP genes (rRBPs) with low expression in LSCs, suggesting the dependency of LSCs on altered ribosome dynamics. In conclusion, our systematic analysis elucidates the RBP transcriptomic landscape in normal and malignant myelopoiesis, and highlights the functional consequences that may result from perturbation of RBP gene expression in these cellular landscapes.},

MYC IHC was performed in 272 consecutive cases of aggressive B-cell lymphoma, and results correlated with fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) for MYC translocations. Among 156 patients with IHC and FISH data, MYC IHC identified MYC translocations with 89\% sensitivity, 38\% specificity, 92\% negative predictive value, and 29\% positive predictive value. Three of 15 (20\%) of DHL were MYC IHC negative. One case contained a MYC translocation detectable IGH/MYC fusion probes but not MYC break-apart probes. A subset of DHL lack MYC protein expression, and recognition of this subset of cases requires FISH testing.

It is a matter of debate whether true BL without MYC translocation exists. Here, we identified 59 lymphomas concordantly called BL by 2 gene expression classifiers among 753 B-cell lymphomas. Only 2 (3\%) of these 59 molecular BL lacked a MYC translocation, which both shared a peculiar pattern of chromosome 11q aberration characterized by interstitial gains including 11q23.2-q23.3 and telomeric losses of 11q24.1-qter. We extended our analysis to 17 MYC-negative high-grade B-cell lymphomas with a similar 11q aberration and showed this aberration to be recurrently associated with morphologic and clinical features of BL. The minimal region of gain was defined by high-level amplifications in 11q23.3 and associated with overexpression of genes including PAFAH1B2 on a transcriptional and protein level. The recurrent region of loss contained a focal homozygous deletion in 11q24.2-q24.3 including the ETS1 gene, which was shown to be mutated in 4 of 16 investigated cases. These findings indicate the existence of a molecularly distinct subset of B-cell lymphomas reminiscent of BL, which is characterized by deregulation of genes in 11q.},

Phylogenetic reconstruction is central to identifying sub-populations and distinguishing the mutational processes that gave rise to them. Existing phylogenetic tree building models do not scale to the tens of thousands of high resolution genomes achievable with current scWGS methods. We constructed a phylogenetic model and associated Bayesian inference procedure, sitka, specifically for scWGS data. The method is based on a novel phylogenetic encoding of copy number (CN) data, the sitka transformation, that simplifies the site dependencies induced by rearrangements while still forming a sound foundation to phylogenetic inference. The sitka transformation allows us to design novel scalable Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms. Moreover, we introduce a novel point mutation calling method that incorporates the CN data and the underlying phylogenetic tree to overcome the low per-cell coverage of scWGS. We demonstrate our method on three single cell datasets, including a novel PDX series, and analyse the topological properties of the inferred trees.

Using a new Wright-Fisher population genetics model8,9 to infer clonal fitness, we found that TP53 mutation alters the fitness landscape, reproducibly distributing fitness over a larger number of clones associated with distinct CNAs. Furthermore, in TNBC PDX models with mutated TP53, inferred fitness coefficients from CNA-based genotypes accurately forecast experimentally enforced clonal competition dynamics. Drug treatment in three long-term serially passaged TNBC PDXs resulted in cisplatin-resistant clones emerging from low-fitness phylogenetic lineages in the untreated setting. Conversely, high-fitness clones from treatment-naive controls were eradicated, signalling an inversion of the fitness landscape. Finally, upon release of drug, selection pressure dynamics were reversed, indicating a fitness cost of treatment resistance. Together, our findings define clonal fitness linked to both CNA and therapeutic resistance in polyclonal tumours.},

We show that Myc is destroyed by ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis, and define two elements in Myc that oppositely regulate its stability: a transcriptional activation domain that promotes Myc destruction, and a region required for association with the POZ domain protein Miz-1 that stabilizes Myc. We also show that Myc is stabilized by cancer-associated and transforming mutations within its transcriptional activation domain. Our data reveal a complex network of interactions regulating Myc destruction, and imply that enhanced protein stability contributes to oncogenic transformation by mutant Myc proteins.},

However, the role of the basal splicing machinery in regulating AS remains poorly understood. Here we show that the core snRNP (small nuclear ribonucleoprotein) protein SmB/B′ self-regulates its expression by promoting the inclusion of a highly conserved alternative exon in its own pre-mRNA that targets the spliced transcript for nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD). Depletion of SmB/B′ in human cells results in reduced levels of snRNPs and a striking reduction in the inclusion levels of hundreds of additional alternative exons, with comparatively few effects on constitutive exon splicing levels. The affected alternative exons are enriched in genes encoding RNA processing and other RNA-binding factors, and a subset of these exons also regulate gene expression by activating NMD. Our results thus demonstrate a role for the core spliceosomal machinery in controlling an exon network that appears to modulate the levels of many RNA processing factors.},

  abstract = {Simple Summary Four-stranded nucleic acid secondary structures (quadruplexes) including DNA G-quadruplexes, RNA G-quadruplexes and i-Motifs display key regulatory functions in the human genome. Quadruplexes play an important role in telomere lengthening and the expression control of several cancer-related genes. In this context, quadruplex ligands are considered as potential strategies for anticancer drug discovery. Previous reviews are mainly focused on ligands targeting DNA G-quadruplexes, RNA G-quadruplexes and i-Motifs in a separate way, hindering a holistic study. The present review overcomes this limitation by providing a general overview of the recent research on ligands targeting the three different quadruplex structures in cancer. Abstract Nucleic acids can adopt alternative secondary conformations including four-stranded structures known as quadruplexes. To date, quadruplexes have been demonstrated to exist both in human chromatin DNA and RNA. In particular, quadruplexes are found in guanine-rich sequences constituting G-quadruplexes, and in cytosine-rich sequences forming i-Motifs as a counterpart. Quadruplexes are associated with key biological processes ranging from transcription and translation of several oncogenes and tumor suppressors to telomeres maintenance and genome instability. In this context, quadruplexes have prompted investigations on their possible role in cancer biology and the evaluation of small-molecule ligands as potential therapeutic agents. This review aims to provide an updated close-up view of the literature on quadruplex ligands in cancer therapy, by grouping together ligands for DNA and RNA G-quadruplexes and DNA i-Motifs.},

  abstract = {In cancer cells, gene expression is altered at the levels of transcription and mRNA maturation, with many splice variants being associated with cancer. Splicing is tightly connected to transcription and can be affected by transcription elongation dynamics. Moreover, various transcriptional coregulators that are altered in cancer, such as the proto-oncogene EWS, are thought to play a role in splicing. A recent study shows that an alteration of EWS in Ewing sarcoma alters the dynamics of RNA polymerase II over the CCND1 proto-oncogene encoding cyclin D1, leading to an increase in its transcription and to an alteration of splicing that results in high levels of the oncogenic cyclin D1b splice isoform. The cyclin D1b isoform is highly expressed in Ewing sarcoma cells and tumors and stimulates Ewing sarcoma cell growth. Thus, alterations of transcriptional regulators in disease may lead to splicing alterations. We review these data and discuss how this concept may apply to various factors that are altered in cancer.}

  abstract = {HNRNPU encodes the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein U, which participates in RNA splicing and chromatin organization. Microdeletions in the 1q44 locus encompassing HNRNPU and other genes and point mutations in HNRNPU cause brain disorders, including early-onset seizures and severe intellectual disability. We aimed to understand HNRNPU’s roles in the developing brain. Our work revealed that HNRNPU loss of function leads to rapid cell death of both postmitotic neurons and neural progenitors, with an apparent higher sensitivity of the latter. Further, expression and alternative splicing of multiple genes involved in cell survival, cell motility, and synapse formation are affected following Hnrnpu’s conditional truncation. Finally, we identified pharmaceutical and genetic agents that can partially reverse the loss of cortical structures in Hnrnpu mutated embryonic brains, ameliorate radial neuronal migration defects and rescue cultured neural progenitors’ cell death., HNRNPU is an RNA splicing protein associated with brain disorders such as early onset seizures. Here they show that HNRNPU functions to maintain neural progenitors and their progeny by regulating splicing of key neuronal genes.},

  abstract = {Neuromuscular disorders such as Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy and Spinal Muscular Atrophy are neurodegenerative genetic diseases characterized primarily by muscle weakness and wasting. Until recently there were no effective therapies for these conditions, but antisense oligonucleotides, a new class of synthetic single stranded molecules of nucleic acids, have demonstrated promising experimental results and are at different stages of regulatory approval. The antisense oligonucleotides can modulate the protein expression via targeting hnRNAs or mRNAs and inducing interference with splicing, mRNA degradation, or arrest of translation, finally, resulting in rescue or reduction of the target protein expression. Different classes of antisense oligonucleotides are being tested in several clinical trials, and limitations of their clinical efficacy and toxicity have been reported for some of these compounds, while more encouraging results have supported the development of others. New generation antisense oligonucleotides are also being tested in preclinical models together with specific delivery systems that could allow some of the limitations of current antisense oligonucleotides to be overcome, to improve the cell penetration, to achieve more robust target engagement, and hopefully also be associated with acceptable toxicity. This review article describes the chemical properties and molecular mechanisms of action of the antisense oligonucleotides and the therapeutic implications these compounds have in neuromuscular diseases. Current strategies and carrier systems available for the oligonucleotides delivery will be also described to provide an overview on the past, present and future of these appealing molecules.},

Here, we studied coding sequence mutations of 50 Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-negative GZLs and 20 polymorphic EBV+ diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) not otherwise specified (poly-EBV-L) in comparison with classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL), primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma (PMBCL), and DLBCL. Exomes of 21 GZL and 7 poly-EBV-L cases, along with paired constitutional DNA, were analyzed as a discovery cohort, followed by targeted sequencing of 217 genes in an extension cohort of 29 GZL and 13 poly-EBV-L cases. GZL cases with thymic niche involvement (anterior mediastinal mass) exhibited a mutation profile closely resembling cHL and PMBCL, with SOCS1 (45\%), B2M (45\%), TNFAIP3 (35\%), GNA13 (35\%), LRRN3 (32\%), and NFKBIA (29\%) being the most recurrently mutated genes. In contrast, GZL cases without thymic niche involvement (n = 18) had a significantly distinct pattern that was enriched in mutations related to apoptosis defects (TP53 [39\%], BCL2 [28\%], BIRC6 [22\%]) and depleted in GNA13, XPO1, or NF-κB signaling pathway mutations (TNFAIP3, NFKBIE, IKBKB, NFKBIA). They also exhibited more BCL2/BCL6 rearrangements compared with thymic GZL. Poly-EBV-L cases presented a distinct mutational profile, including STAT3 mutations and a significantly lower coding mutation load in comparison with EBV- GZL. Our study highlights characteristic mutational patterns in GZL associated with presentation in the thymic niche, suggesting a common cell of origin and disease evolution overlapping with related anterior mediastinal lymphomas.},

However, only a few studies of MUM1-positive (MUM1) BL have been reported, and its characteristics still remain controversial. To highlight the features of MUM1 BL, we compared the clinicopathologic characteristics of 37 cases of MUM1 and 51 cases of MUM1-negative (MUM1) BL in Japan. Compared with MUM1 BL, patients with MUM1 BL showed significantly younger onset (P=0.0062) and a higher ratio of females (P=0.013). We have also revealed the difference in the involved sites. The MUM1 group showed lower incidences of involvement of stomach (P=0.012) and tonsil (P=0.069). There was a more tendency in MUM1 group to involve colon (P=0.072), breast (P=0.073), and kidney (P=0.073). Regarding the prognosis, a trend toward a lower overall survival for MUM1 group was noted (P=0.089). Notably, comparing MUM1 and MUM1 BL cases of adults (age16 y old and above), the former showed significantly worse prognosis (P=0.041). Among the BL patients treated with the intensive chemotherapy, a standard therapy for BL, MUM1 cases showed worse prognosis (P=0.056). In conclusion, MUM1 BL showed worse prognosis, particularly in adult cases, compared with MUM1 BL. In addition, the difference of the onset age, sex ratio, and involved sites between the 2 groups was noted. Our results demonstrate that MUM1 expression might predict worse prognosis of BL, and MUM1 BL should be distinguished from MUM1 BL.},

Here, we assess the performance of a massively parallel droplet-based method for mapping transposase-accessible chromatin in single cells using sequencing (scATAC-seq). We apply scATAC-seq to obtain chromatin profiles of more than 200,000 single cells in human blood and basal cell carcinoma. In blood, application of scATAC-seq enables marker-free identification of cell type-specific cis- and trans-regulatory elements, mapping of disease-associated enhancer activity and reconstruction of trajectories of cellular differentiation. In basal cell carcinoma, application of scATAC-seq reveals regulatory networks in malignant, stromal and immune cells in the tumor microenvironment. Analysis of scATAC-seq profiles from serial tumor biopsies before and after programmed cell death protein 1 blockade identifies chromatin regulators of therapy-responsive T cell subsets and reveals a shared regulatory program that governs intratumoral CD8+ T cell exhaustion and CD4+ T follicular helper cell development. We anticipate that scATAC-seq will enable the unbiased discovery of gene regulatory factors across diverse biological systems.},

The consequent increased demand for somatic variant analysis of paired samples requires methods specialized to model this problem so as to sensitively call variants at any practical level of tumor impurity. RESULTS: We describe Strelka, a method for somatic SNV and small indel detection from sequencing data of matched tumor-normal samples. The method uses a novel Bayesian approach which represents continuous allele frequencies for both tumor and normal samples, while leveraging the expected genotype structure of the normal. This is achieved by representing the normal sample as a mixture of germline variation with noise, and representing the tumor sample as a mixture of the normal sample with somatic variation. A natural consequence of the model structure is that sensitivity can be maintained at high tumor impurity without requiring purity estimates. We demonstrate that the method has superior accuracy and sensitivity on impure samples compared with approaches based on either diploid genotype likelihoods or general allele-frequency tests.

  abstract = {Burkitt's lymphoma (BL) can often be cured by intensive chemotherapy, but the toxicity of such therapy precludes its use in the elderly and in patients with endemic BL in developing countries, necessitating new strategies. The normal germinal centre B cell is the presumed cell of origin for both BL and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), yet gene expression analysis suggests that these malignancies may use different oncogenic pathways. BL is subdivided into a sporadic subtype that is diagnosed in developed countries, the Epstein-Barr-virus-associated endemic subtype, and an HIV-associated subtype, but it is unclear whether these subtypes use similar or divergent oncogenic mechanisms. Here we used high-throughput RNA sequencing and RNA interference screening to discover essential regulatory pathways in BL that cooperate with MYC, the defining oncogene of this cancer. In 70\% of sporadic BL cases, mutations affecting the transcription factor TCF3 (E2A) or its negative regulator ID3 fostered TCF3 dependency. TCF3 activated the pro-survival phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase pathway in BL, in part by augmenting tonic B-cell receptor signalling. In 38\% of sporadic BL cases, oncogenic CCND3 mutations produced highly stable cyclin D3 isoforms that drive cell cycle progression. These findings suggest opportunities to improve therapy for patients with BL.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (DLBCLs) are phenotypically and genetically heterogeneous. Gene-expression profiling has identified subgroups of DLBCL (activated B-cell-like [ABC], germinal-center B-cell-like [GCB], and unclassified) according to cell of origin that are associated with a differential response to chemotherapy and targeted agents. We sought to extend these findings by identifying genetic subtypes of DLBCL based on shared genomic abnormalities and to uncover therapeutic vulnerabilities based on tumor genetics. METHODS: We studied 574 DLBCL biopsy samples using exome and transcriptome sequencing, array-based DNA copy-number analysis, and targeted amplicon resequencing of 372 genes to identify genes with recurrent aberrations. We developed and implemented an algorithm to discover genetic subtypes based on the co-occurrence of genetic alterations. RESULTS: We identified four prominent genetic subtypes in DLBCL, termed MCD (based on the co-occurrence of MYD88L265P and CD79B mutations), BN2 (based on BCL6 fusions and NOTCH2 mutations), N1 (based on NOTCH1 mutations), and EZB (based on EZH2 mutations and BCL2 translocations). Genetic aberrations in multiple genes distinguished each genetic subtype from other DLBCLs. These subtypes differed phenotypically, as judged by differences in gene-expression signatures and responses to immunochemotherapy, with favorable survival in the BN2 and EZB subtypes and inferior outcomes in the MCD and N1 subtypes. Analysis of genetic pathways suggested that MCD and BN2 DLBCLs rely on "chronic active" B-cell receptor signaling that is amenable to therapeutic inhibition. CONCLUSIONS: We uncovered genetic subtypes of DLBCL with distinct genotypic, epigenetic, and clinical characteristics, providing a potential nosology for precision-medicine strategies in DLBCL.

  abstract = {Proliferation and survival of Hodgkin and Reed/Sternberg (HRS) cells, the malignant cells of classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL), are dependent on constitutive activation of nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB). NF-kappaB activation through various stimuli is negatively regulated by the zinc finger protein A20. To determine whether A20 contributes to the pathogenesis of cHL, we sequenced TNFAIP3, encoding A20, in HL cell lines and laser-microdissected HRS cells from cHL biopsies. We detected somatic mutations in 16 out of 36 cHLs (44\%), including missense mutations in 2 out of 16 Epstein-Barr virus-positive (EBV(+)) cHLs and a missense mutation, nonsense mutations, and frameshift-causing insertions or deletions in 14 out of 20 EBV(-) cHLs. In most mutated cases, both TNFAIP3 alleles were inactivated, including frequent chromosomal deletions of TNFAIP3. Reconstitution of wild-type TNFAIP3 in A20-deficient cHL cell lines revealed a significant decrease in transcripts of selected NF-kappaB target genes and caused cytotoxicity. Extending the mutation analysis to primary mediastinal B cell lymphoma (PMBL), another lymphoma with constitutive NF-kappaB activity, revealed destructive mutations in 5 out of 14 PMBLs (36\%). This report identifies TNFAIP3 (A20), a key regulator of NF-kappaB activity, as a novel tumor suppressor gene in cHL and PMBL. The significantly higher frequency of TNFAIP3 mutations in EBV(-) than EBV(+) cHL suggests complementing functions of TNFAIP3 inactivation and EBV infection in cHL pathogenesis.},

As mutations of the CD58 gene contribute to immune evasion of diffuse large B cell lymphoma tumor cells, we studied whether alterations of the CD58 gene also occur in Hodgkin and Reed/Sternberg (HRS) cells of cHL. Single nucleotide polymorphism chip analysis revealed homozygous deletions within the CD58 gene in two cHL cell lines (SUP-HD1 and U-HO1). Sequencing of the CD58 gene in seven cHL cell lines disclosed in addition a homozygous splice site mutation in cell line KM-H2. None of the three mutated lines expressed CD58 protein on their surface. Thus, three of seven cHL cell lines analyzed harbor destructive CD58 mutations. Molecular analysis of isolated HRS cells from 10 primary cases of cHL; however, did not reveal any case with a CD58 mutation. A FICTION study indicated heterozygous deletions of CD58 in 3 of 13 cHL analyzed. Overall, we report frequent inactivating mutations of CD58 in cHL cell lines, but their rare occurrence in primary HRS cells. As the three cHL cell lines with CD58 mutations were all established from HRS cells located in pleural effusions, i.e., outside the normal lymph node microenvironment, in end-stages of the disease, CD58 inactivation in cHL might be predominantly prevalent to such situations.},

Four mutations, all within the 5' region, were detected in three cases of primary nodal DLBCL (6.3\% of primary DLBCL), probably originated as by-products of the somatic hypermutation process. No CD95 mutations in the two analyzed regions were detected in primary extranodal DLBCL, mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma (MLBCL), and DLBCL arising from indolent low-grade lymphomas. Because of our results, a review of published data with respect to the site of mutations was performed, which suggested a different distribution of mutations in nodal and extranodal DLBCL.},

Indeed, existing pipelines for the development of ASO therapies for spinocerebellar ataxias, Huntington disease, Alzheimer disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Parkinson disease, and others, and increased focus by the pharmaceutical industry on ASO development, strengthen the outlook for using ASOs for neurodegenerative diseases. Perhaps the most significant advantage to ASO therapeutics over other small molecule approaches is that acquisition of the target sequence provides immediate knowledge of putative complementary oligonucleotide therapeutics. In this review, we describe the various types of ASOs, how they are used therapeutically, and the present efforts to develop new ASO therapies that will contribute to a forthcoming toolkit for treating multiple neurodegenerative diseases.},

Accurate diagnosis would appear to mandate fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) for all tumors with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) morphology. We present the results of FISH, cell-of-origin, and immunohistochemistry (IHC) testing from 1228 DLBCL biopsies from 3 clinical trials and a population-based registry. HGBL-DH/TH made up 7.9\% of the DLBCL, confined primarily to the germinal center B-cell–like (GCB; 13.3\%) compared with activated B-cell-like (ABC; 1.7\%) subtype (P {$<$} .001). HGBL-DH/TH with BCL2 rearrangement is a GCB phenomenon with no cases observed in 415 ABC DLBCL. A screening strategy restricting FISH testing to tumors of GCB subtype (by Lymph2Cx or Hans IHC) plus dual protein expression of MYC and BCL2 by IHC could limit testing to 11\% to 14\% of tumors, with a positive predictive value of 30\% to 37\%; however, this strategy would miss approximately one-quarter of tumors with HBGL-DH/TH with BCL2 rearrangement and one-third of all HGBL-DH/TH. These results provide accurate estimation of the proportion of HGBL-DH/TH among tumors with DLBCL morphology and allow determination of the impact of various methods available to screen DLBCL tumors for FISH testing.},

  abstract = {PurposeMantle cell lymphoma is an aggressive B-cell neoplasm that displays heterogeneous outcomes after treatment. In 2003, the Lymphoma/Leukemia Molecular Profiling Project described a powerful biomarker—the proliferation signature—using gene expression in fresh frozen material. Herein, we describe the training and validation of a new assay that measures the proliferation signature in RNA derived from routinely available formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) biopsies.MethodsForty-seven FFPE biopsies were used to train an assay on the NanoString platform, using microarray gene expression data of matched fresh frozen biopsies as a gold standard. The locked assay was applied to pretreatment FFPE lymph node biopsies from an independent cohort of 110 patients uniformly treated with rituximab plus cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone. Seventeen biopsies were tested across three laboratories to assess assay reproducibility.ResultsThe MCL35 assay, which contained a 17-gene proliferation signature, yielded gene expression of sufficient quality to assign an assay score and risk group in 108 (98\%) of 110 archival FFPE biopsies. The MCL35 assay assigned patients to high-risk (26\%), standard-risk (29\%), and low-risk (45\%) groups, with different lengths of overall survival (OS): a median of 1.1, 2.6, and 8.6 years, respectively (log-rank for trend, P {$<$} .001). In multivariable analysis, these risk groups and the Mantle Cell Lymphoma International Prognostic Index were independently associated with OS (P {$<$} .001 for both variables). Concordance of risk assignment across the three independent laboratories was 100\%.ConclusionThe newly developed and validated MCL35 assay for FFPE biopsies uses the proliferation signature to define groups of patients with significantly different OS independent of the Mantle Cell Lymphoma International Prognostic Index. Importantly, the analytic and clinical validity of this assay defines it as a reliable biomarker to support risk-adapted clinical trials.}

Conventional cytogenetics identifies some patients with rearrangements of MYC and BCL2 and/or BCL6 (double-hit lymphomas) who are increasingly treated with more intensive chemotherapy, but a more biologically coherent and clinically useful definition of this group is required.Patients and MethodsWe defined a molecular high-grade (MHG) group by applying a gene expression–based classifier to 928 patients with DLBCL from a clinical trial that investigated the addition of bortezomib to standard rituximab plus cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (R-CHOP) therapy. The prognostic significance of MHG was compared with existing biomarkers. We performed targeted sequencing of 70 genes in 400 patients and explored molecular pathology using gene expression signature databases. Findings were validated in an independent data set.ResultsThe MHG group comprised 83 patients (9\%), with 75 in the cell-of-origin germinal center B-cell-like group. MYC rearranged and double-hit groups were strongly over-represented in MHG but comprised only one half of the total. Gene expression analysis revealed a proliferative phenotype with a relationship to centroblasts. Progression-free survival rate at 36 months after R-CHOP in the MHG group was 37\% (95\% CI, 24\% to 55\%) compared with 72\% (95\% CI, 68\% to 77\%) for others, and an analysis of treatment effects suggested a possible positive effect of bortezomib. Double-hit lymphomas lacking the MHG signature showed no evidence of worse outcome than other germinal center B-cell-like cases.ConclusionMHG defines a biologically coherent high-grade B-cell lymphoma group with distinct molecular features and clinical outcomes that effectively doubles the size of the poor-prognosis, double-hit group. Patients with MHG may benefit from intensified chemotherapy or novel targeted therapies.}

  abstract = {Dogs were the first domesticated species, originating at least 15,000 y ago from Eurasian gray wolves. Dogs today consist primarily of two specialized groups—a diverse set of nearly 400 pure breeds and a far more populous group of free-ranging animals adapted to a human commensal lifestyle (village dogs). Village dogs are more genetically diverse and geographically widespread than purebred dogs making them vital for unraveling dog population history. Using a semicustom 185,805-marker genotyping array, we conducted a large-scale survey of autosomal, mitochondrial, and Y chromosome diversity in 4,676 purebred dogs from 161 breeds and 549 village dogs from 38 countries. Geographic structure shows both isolation and gene flow have shaped genetic diversity in village dog populations. Some populations (notably those in the Neotropics and the South Pacific) are almost completely derived from European stock, whereas others are clearly admixed between indigenous and European dogs. Importantly, many populations—including those of Vietnam, India, and Egypt—show minimal evidence of European admixture. These populations exhibit a clear gradient of short-range linkage disequilibrium consistent with a Central Asian domestication origin.},

  abstract = {Background Classifiers based on molecular criteria such as gene expression signatures have been developed to distinguish Burkitt lymphoma and diffuse large B cell lymphoma, which help to explore the intermediate cases where traditional diagnosis is difficult. Transfer of these research classifiers into a clinical setting is challenging because there are competing classifiers in the literature based on different methodology and gene sets with no clear best choice; classifiers based on one expression measurement platform may not transfer effectively to another; and, classifiers developed using fresh frozen samples may not work effectively with the commonly used and more convenient formalin fixed paraffin-embedded samples used in routine diagnosis. Methods Here we thoroughly compared two published high profile classifiers developed on data from different Affymetrix array platforms and fresh-frozen tissue, examining their transferability and concordance. Based on this analysis, a new Burkitt and diffuse large B cell lymphoma classifier (BDC) was developed and employed on Illumina DASL data from our own paraffin-embedded samples, allowing comparison with the diagnosis made in a central haematopathology laboratory and evaluation of clinical relevance. Results We show that both previous classifiers can be recapitulated using very much smaller gene sets than originally employed, and that the classification result is closely dependent on the Burkitt lymphoma criteria applied in the training set. The BDC classification on our data exhibits high agreement (\textasciitilde 95 \%) with the original diagnosis. A simple outcome comparison in the patients presenting intermediate features on conventional criteria suggests that the cases classified as Burkitt lymphoma by BDC have worse response to standard diffuse large B cell lymphoma treatment than those classified as diffuse large B cell lymphoma. Conclusions In this study, we comprehensively investigate two previous Burkitt lymphoma molecular classifiers, and implement a new gene expression classifier, BDC, that works effectively on paraffin-embedded samples and provides useful information for treatment decisions.

  abstract = {The regulation of B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL2) protein expression in germinal center (GC) B cells has been controversial. Previous reports have indicated posttranscriptional regulation plays a dominant role. However, a number of recent studies contradicted these reports. Using real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and Standardized Reverse Transcriptase-PCR (StaRT-PCR), we measured the level of mRNA expression in GC, mantle zone (MNZ), and marginal zone (MGZ) cells from laser capture microdissection. Both quantitative RT-PCR measurements of microdissected GC cells from tonsils showed that GC cells had low expression of BCL2 transcripts commensurate with the low protein expression level. These results are in agreement with microarray studies on fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS)-sorted cells and microdissected GC cells. We also examined BCL2 mRNA and protein expression on a series of 30 cases of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and found, in general, a good correlation. The results suggested that BCL2 protein expression is regulated at the transcriptional level in normal B cells and in the neoplastic cells in most B-cell lymphoproliferative disorders.}

Current methods for the detection of circulating tumour DNA involve sequencing somatic mutations using cell-free DNA, but the sensitivity of these methods may be low among patients with early-stage cancer given the limited number of recurrent mutations2-5. By contrast, large-scale epigenetic alterations-which are tissue- and cancer-type specific-are not similarly constrained6 and therefore potentially have greater ability to detect and classify cancers in patients with early-stage disease. Here we develop a sensitive, immunoprecipitation-based protocol to analyse the methylome of small quantities of circulating cell-free DNA, and demonstrate the ability to detect large-scale DNA methylation changes that are enriched for tumour-specific patterns. We also demonstrate robust performance in cancer detection and classification across an extensive collection of plasma samples from several tumour types. This work sets the stage to establish biomarkers for the minimally invasive detection, interception and classification of early-stage cancers based on plasma cell-free DNA methylation patterns.},

We and others have recently shown that the human BCL6 gene is also hypermutated in human peripheral blood memory B cells and tonsils. A preliminary analysis of other non-Ig genes (c-Myc, S14 and AFP) suggested that they were not mutated in memory B cells. We have now performed an in-depth analysis of three non-Ig genes that are expressed in germinal center B cells in two human donors in whom BCL6 is highly mutated. It was found that the TATA binding protein (TBP), c-Myc and survivin genes are not hypermutated. This lack of targeting by the Ig hypermutation mechanism must be due to the lack of regulatory DNA elements, since the primary sequences of the three tested genes have at least as high intrinsic mutability indices as the BCL6 gene.}

The RNA-binding protein hnRNP A1 (A1) was also critical to IL-6-stimulated translation. Because A1 shuttles between nucleus and cytoplasm, we investigated whether the ability of IL-6 to enhance Myc translation was mediated by stimulation of A1 shuttling. In MM cell lines and primary specimens, IL-6 increased A1 cytoplasmic localization. In contrast, there was no effect on the total cellular levels of A1. Use of a dominant negative A1 construct, which prevents endogenous A1 from nucleus-to-cytoplasm transit, prevented the ability of IL-6 to enhance Myc internal ribosome entry site activity, Myc protein expression, and MM cell growth. IL-6-stimulated cytoplasmic localization was mediated by alterations in the C-terminal M9 peptide of A1, and this correlated with the ability of IL-6 to induce serine phosphorylation of this domain. A p38 kinase inhibitor prevented IL-6-induced A1 phosphorylation. Thus, IL-6 activates c-Myc translation in MM cells by inducing A1 phosphorylation and cytoplasmic localization in a p38-dependent fashion. These data suggest A1 as a potential therapeutic target in MM.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

To test a role for interleukin (IL)-6 in myc translation, we studied the IL-6–responsive ANBL-6 and IL-6–autocrine U266 cell lines as well as primary patient samples. IL-6 increased c-myc translation, which was resistant to rapamycin, indicating a mechanism independent of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and cap-dependent translation. In contrast, the cytokine enhanced cap-independent translation via a stimulatory effect on the myc internal ribosome entry site (IRES). As known IRES-trans–activating factors (ITAF) were unaffected by IL-6, we used a yeast-three-hybrid screen to identify novel ITAFs and identified hnRNP A1 (A1) as a mediator of the IL-6 effect. A1 specifically interacted with the myc IRES in filter binding assays as well as EMSAs. Treatment of myeloma cells with IL-6 induced serine phosphorylation of A1 and increased its binding to the myc IRES in vivo in myeloma cells. Primary patient samples also showed binding between A1 and the IRES. RNA interference to knock down hnRNP A1 prevented an IL-6 increase in myc protein expression, myc IRES activity, and cell growth. These data point to hnRNP A1 as a critical regulator of c-myc translation and a potential therapeutic target in multiple myeloma. [Cancer Res 2008;68(24):10215–22]}

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Poly C Binding Protein 1 (PCBP1) is an RNA-binding protein that binds and regulates translational activity of subsets of cellular mRNAs. Depletion of PCBP1 is implicated in various carcinomas, but the underlying mechanism in tumorigenesis remains elusive. METHODS: We performed a transcriptome-wide screen to identify novel bounding mRNA of PCBP1. The bind regions between PCBP1 with target mRNA were investigated by using point mutation and luciferase assay. Cell proliferation, cell cycle, tumorigenesis and cell apoptosis were also evaluated in ovary and colon cancer cell lines. The mechanism that PCBP1 affects p27 was analyzed by mRNA stability and ribosome profiling assays. We analyzed PCBP1 and p27 expression in ovary, colon and renal tumor samples and adjacent non-tumor tissues using RT-PCR, Western Blotting and immunohistochemistry. The prognostic significance of PCBP1 and p27 also analyzed using online databases. RESULTS: We identified cell cycle inhibitor p27Kip1 (p27) as a novel PCBP1-bound transcript. We then demonstrated that binding of PCBP1 to p27 3'UTR via its KH1 domain mainly stabilizes p27 mRNA, while enhances its translation to fuel p27 expression, prior to p27 protein degradation. The upregulated p27 consequently inhibits cell proliferation, cell cycle progression and tumorigenesis, whereas promotes cell apoptosis under paclitaxel treatment. Conversely, knockdown of PCBP1 in turn compromises p27 mRNA stability, leading to lower p27 level and tumorigenesis in vivo. Moreover, forced depletion of p27 counteracts the tumor suppressive ability of PCBP1 in the same PCBP1 over-expressing cells. Physiologically, we showed that decreases of both p27 mRNA and its protein expressions are well correlated to PCBP1 depletion in ovary, colon and renal tumor samples, independent of the p27 ubiquitin ligase Skp2 level. Correlation of PCBP1 with p27 is also found in the tamoxifen, doxorubincin and lapatinib resistant breast cancer cells of GEO database. CONCLUSION: Our results thereby indicate that loss of PCBP1 expression firstly attenuates p27 expression at post-transcriptional level, and subsequently promotes carcinogenesis. PCBP1 could be used as a diagnostic marker to cancer patients.},

The advent of high-resolution SNP arrays has made it possible to identify CNVs. Characterization of widespread constitutional (germline) CNVs has provided insight into their role in susceptibility to a wide spectrum of diseases, and somatic CNVs can be used to identify regions of the genome involved in disease phenotypes. The role of CNVs as risk factors for cancer is currently underappreciated. However, the genomic instability and structural dynamism that characterize cancer cells would seem to make this form of genetic variation particularly intriguing to study in cancer. Here, we provide a detailed overview of the current understanding of the CNVs that arise in the human genome and explore the emerging literature that reveals associations of both constitutional and somatic CNVs with a wide variety of human cancers.}

Mutations in this gene cause the autosomal recessive syndrome ataxia telangiectasia (AT), an attribute of which is an increased risk of cancer, particularly lymphoma. We have undertaken a population-based case/control study to assess the influence of genetic variation in ATM on the risk of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). A number of the subtypes that constitute NHL have in common the occurrence of specific somatic translocations that contribute to lymphomagenesis. We hypothesize that ATM function is slightly attenuated by some variants, which could reduce double-stranded break repair capacity, contributing to the occurrence of translocations and subsequent lymphomas. We sequenced the promoter and all exons of ATM in the germline DNA of 86 NHL patients and identified 79 variants. Eighteen of these variants correspond to nonsynonymous amino acid differences, 6 of which were predicted to be deleterious to protein function; these variants were all rare. Eleven common variants make up 10 haplotypes that are specified by 7 tagSNPs. Linkage disequilibrium across the ATM gene is high but incomplete. TagSNPs and the 6 putatively deleterious variants were genotyped in 798 NHL cases and 793 controls. Our results indicate that common variants of ATM do not significantly contribute to the risk of NHL in the general population. However, some rare, functionally deleterious variants may contribute to an increased risk of development of rare subtypes of the disease. © 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.}

Here we find that Xenopus laevis and human DAZAP1, which are each expressed as short and long forms, act as mRNA-specific activators of translation in a manner that is sensitive to the number of binding sites present within the 3' UTR. Domain mapping suggests that this conserved function is mainly associated with C-terminal regions of DAZAP1. Interestingly, we find that the expression of xDAZAP1 and its polysome association are developmentally controlled, the latter suggesting that the translational activator function of DAZAP1 is regulated. However, ERK phosphorylation of DAZAP1, which can alter protein interactions with its C terminus, does not play a role in regulating its ability to participate in translational complexes. Since relatively few mRNA-specific activators have been identified, we explored the mechanism by which DAZAP1 activates translation. By utilizing reporter mRNAs with internal ribosome entry sites, we establish that DAZAP1 stimulates translation initiation. Importantly, this activity is not dependent on the recognition of the 5' cap by initiation factors, showing that it functions downstream from this frequently regulated event, but is modulated by changes in the adenylation status of mRNAs. This suggests a function in the formation of "end-to-end" complexes, which are important for efficient initiation, which we show to be independent of a direct interaction with the bridging protein eIF4G.},

  abstract = {The genetic and mutational basis of canine lymphoma remains poorly understood. Several genes, including TRAF3 and POT1, are mutated in canine B-cell lymphoma (cBCL), and are likely involved in the pathogenesis of this disease. The purpose of this study was to assess the prevalence of TRAF3 and POT1 mutations in a cohort of dogs with cBCL, compared to dogs with non-cBCL diseases (including four dogs with T-cell lymphoma [cTCL]). Forty-nine dogs were included (n = 24 cBCL; n = 25 non-cBCL). Eleven dogs had matched non-tumour DNA assessed to determine if mutations were germline or somatic. All dogs had TRAF3 and POT1 assessed by Sanger sequencing. The prevalence of deleterious TRAF3 and POT1 mutations in cBCL was 36\% and 17\%, respectively. A deleterious TRAF3 mutation was suspected to be germline in 1/5 cases with matched non-tumour DNA available for comparison. Deleterious mutations were not found in specimens from the non-cBCL group. Several synonymous variants were identified in both genes in cBCL and non-cBCL samples, which likely represent polymorphisms. These results indicate TRAF3 and POT1 mutations are common in cBCL. Deleterious TRAF3 and POT1 mutations were only identified in dogs with cBCL, and not in dogs with non-cBCL diseases, suggesting they are important in the pathogenesis of cBCL. Future studies to investigate the prognostic and therapeutic implications of these mutations are required.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: For women with ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) of the breast, the risk of developing an ipsilateral breast event (IBE; defined as local recurrence of DCIS or invasive carcinoma) after surgical excision without radiation is not well defined by clinical and pathologic characteristics. METHODS: The Oncotype DX breast cancer assay was performed for patients with DCIS treated with surgical excision without radiation in the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) E5194 study. The association of the prospectively defined DCIS Score (calculated from seven cancer-related genes and five reference genes) with the risk of developing an IBE was analyzed using Cox regression. All statistical tests were two-sided. RESULTS: There were 327 patients with adequate tissue for analysis. The continuous DCIS Score was statistically significantly associated with the risk of developing an IBE (hazard ratio [HR] = 2.31, 95\% confidence interval [CI] = 1.15 to 4.49; P = .02) when adjusted for tamoxifen use (prespecified primary analysis) and with invasive IBE (unadjusted HR = 3.68, 95\% CI = 1.34 to 9.62; P = .01). For the prespecified DCIS risk groups of low, intermediate, and high, the 10-year risks of developing an IBE were 10.6\%, 26.7\%, and 25.9\%, respectively, and for an invasive IBE, 3.7\%, 12.3\%, and 19.2\%, respectively (both log rank P ≤ .006). In multivariable analyses, factors associated with IBE risk were DCIS Score, tumor size, and menopausal status (all P ≤ .02). CONCLUSIONS: The DCIS Score quantifies IBE risk and invasive IBE risk, complements traditional clinical and pathologic factors, and provides a new clinical tool to improve selecting individualized treatment for women with DCIS who meet the ECOG E5194 criteria.},

  abstract = {Nodal marginal zone lymphoma (NMZL) is a rare, indolent B-cell tumor that is distinguished from splenic marginal zone lymphoma (SMZL) by the different pattern of dissemination. NMZL still lacks distinct markers and remains orphan of specific cancer gene lesions. By combining whole-exome sequencing, targeted sequencing of tumor-related genes, whole-transcriptome sequencing, and high-resolution single nucleotide polymorphism array analysis, we aimed at disclosing the pathways that are molecularly deregulated in NMZL and we compare the molecular profile of NMZL with that of SMZL. These analyses identified a distinctive pattern of nonsilent somatic lesions in NMZL. In 35 NMZL patients, 41 genes were found recurrently affected in ≥3 (9\%) cases, including highly prevalent molecular lesions of MLL2 (also known as KMT2D; 34\%), PTPRD (20\%), NOTCH2 (20\%), and KLF2 (17\%). Mutations of PTPRD, a receptor-type protein tyrosine phosphatase regulating cell growth, were enriched in NMZL across mature B-cell tumors, functionally caused the loss of the phosphatase activity of PTPRD, and were associated with cell-cycle transcriptional program deregulation and increased proliferation index in NMZL. Although NMZL shared with SMZL a common mutation profile, NMZL harbored PTPRD lesions that were otherwise absent in SMZL. Collectively, these findings provide new insights into the genetics of NMZL, identify PTPRD lesions as a novel marker for this lymphoma across mature B-cell tumors, and support the distinction of NMZL as an independent clinicopathologic entity within the current lymphoma classification.}

However, dissecting these cell states and their clinical relevance at scale remains challenging. Here, we implemented EcoTyper, a machine-learning framework integrating transcriptome deconvolution and single-cell RNA sequencing, to characterize clinically relevant DLBCL cell states and ecosystems. Using this approach, we identified five cell states of malignant B cells that vary in prognostic associations and differentiation status. We also identified striking variation in cell states for 12 other lineages comprising the TME and forming cell state interactions in stereotyped ecosystems. While cell-of-origin subtypes have distinct TME composition, DLBCL ecosystems capture clinical heterogeneity within existing subtypes and extend beyond cell-of-origin and genotypic classes. These results resolve the DLBCL microenvironment at systems-level resolution and identify opportunities for therapeutic targeting (https://ecotyper.stanford.edu/lymphoma).},

  abstract = {Bortezomib (Velcal) was the first proteasome inhibitor to be approved by the US Food and Drug Administration to treat patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myelomas. Previous studies have demonstrated that bortezomib inhibits tumor cell proliferation and induces apoptosis by blocking the nuclear factor (NF)-κB pathway. However, the exact mechanism by which bortezomib induces cancer cell apoptosis is still not well understood. In this study, we found that bortezomib significantly inhibited cell proliferation in both human Burkitt's lymphoma CA46 and Daudi cells. Through proteomic analysis, we found that bortezomib treatment changed the expression of various proteins in distinct functional categories including unfolding protein response (UPS), RNA processing, protein targeting and biosynthesis, apoptosis, and signal transduction. Among the proteins with altered expression, hnRNP K, hnRNP H, Hsp90α, Grp78, and Hsp7C were common to both Daudi and CA46 cells. Interestingly, bortezomib treatment downregulated the expression of high-molecular-weight (HMw) hnRNP K and c-Myc but upregulated the expression of low-molecular-weight (LMw) hnRNP K. Moreover, cell proliferation was significantly correlated with high expression of HMw hnRNP K and c-Myc. HMw and LMw hnRNP K were identified as sumoylated and desumoylated hnRNP K, respectively. Using transient transfection, we found that sumoylated hnRNP K increased c-Myc expression at the translational level and contributed to cell proliferation, and that Lys422 of hnRNP K is the candidate sumoylated residue. Our results suggest that besides inhibiting the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, bortezomib may inhibit cell proliferation by downregulating sumoylated hnRNP K and c-Myc expression in Burkitt's lymphoma cells.},

RESULTS: Twenty three percent of samples were positive for the Bcl-2/IgH rearrangement, with approximately 3\% of these at levels of more than 1 in 10(4) cells. CONCLUSION: The presence of circulating Bcl-2/IgH+ cells, other than those derived from the malignant clone, could confound the detection and quantitation of minimal residual disease in patients with FL, particularly at low levels of tumor burden.},

  abstract = {AIM To investigate the expression characteristics of heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein H1 (HNRNPH1) mRNA and protein in cell lines and tissues of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). METHODS Western blotting was used to assess the expression of HNRNPH1 protein in seven ESCC cell lines and 30 paired fresh tissue specimens. The subcellular localization of HNRNPH1 was determined by immunofluorescence in ESCC cells. The RNA sequencing data from 87 patients with ESCC were obtained from the cancer genome atlas (TCGA), and the expression and clinical characteristics analysis of different transcript variants of HNRNPH1 were evaluated in this dataset. In addition, immunohistochemistry was carried out to detect the expression of HNRNPH1 protein in 125 patients. RESULTS The expression of HNRNPH1 protein varied across different ESCC cell lines. It was exclusively restricted to the nucleus of the ESCC cells. There are two transcript variants of the HNRNPH1 gene. Variant 1 was constitutively expressed, and its expression did not change during tumorigenesis. In contrast, levels of variant 2 were low in non-tumorous tissues and were dramatically increased in ESCC (P = 0.0026). The high levels of variant 2 were associated with poorer differentiated tumors (P = 0.0287). Furthermore, in paired fresh tissue specimens, HNRNPH1 protein was overexpressed in 73.3\% (22/30) of neoplastic tissues. HNRNPH1 was significantly upregulated in ESCC, with strong staining in 43.2\% (54/125) of tumor tissues and 22.4\% (28/125) of matched non-cancerous tissues (P = 0.0005). Positive HNRNPH1 expression was significantly associated with poor tumor differentiation degree (P = 0.0337). CONCLUSION The different alternative transcript variants of HNRNPH1 exhibited different expression changes during tumorigenesis. Its mRNA and protein were overexpressed in ESCC and associated with poorer differentiation of tumor cells. These findings highlight the potential of HNRNPH1 in the therapy and diagnosis of ESCC.},

Addition of several general RNA binding proteins, such as hnRNP A1, La autoantigen, pyrimidine tract binding protein (hnRNP I/PTB) and the major core protein of cytoplasmic mRNP (p50), rendered translation in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate cap dependent. These proteins drastically inhibited the translation of an uncapped mRNA, but had no effect on translation of a capped mRNA. Based on these and other results, we suggest that one function of general mRNA binding proteins in the cytoplasm is to promote ribosome binding by a 5' end, cap-mediated mechanism, and prevent spurious initiations at aberrant translation start sites.},

  abstract = {The last century and a half has seen first the recognition of lymphomas, and then the publication of one lymphoma classification after another often together with highly critical comments about preceding classifications or a welcome that was less than warm. The introduction of HUMAN PATHOLOGY in 1970 came just before one of the very acrimonious periods in lymphoma classification, as we were learning more about the normal immune system and with the proposed functional lymphoma classifications of Lukes/Collins and Kiel in 1974 relating the lymphomas to their normal B-cell or T-cell 'counterparts'. Those difficult times were followed by the regressive strictly morphologic NCI Working Formulation in 1982, with the REAL classification in 1994 putting us back on a rational path, once again grouping the lymphoid neoplasms first into those of B-cell and T- and putative NK-cell origin, and then using multiple parameters to define specific entities. Planning for the first modern WHO lymphoma classification began soon afterward, with concordance and collegiality leading to the 2001 WHO classification, which then evolved with publication of the 2008 and 2016 WHO classifications. While this review looks at these important past developments which have gotten us to where we are today, it also concentrates on where we are now, what has been learned since the most recent WHO classification and 'Blue Book' were published and on some of the unanswered questions that remain as we look to the future.},

  abstract = {A homopurine/homopyrimidine-like sequence is found 100-150 base pairs upstream of the human c-myc promoter P1. This element, termed the CT-element, has been shown to augment expression from P1, and it serves as a positive transcriptional element when coupled to a heterologous promoter in vivo and in vitro. Synthetic oligonucleotides comprising this element were used to form DNA-protein complexes in electrophoretic mobility shift assays. By using conventional and affinity methods, 61- and 34-kDa proteins were shown to be associated with these complexes. Amino acid sequence analysis and immunological methods have identified these proteins as heterogeneous ribonucleoprotein particle (hnRNP) proteins K and A1. Surprisingly, hnRNP protein K binds to the pyrimidine-rich strand of the CT-element in a sequence-specific manner as well as to the double-stranded molecule. Cotransfection of vectors encoding hnRNP protein K in the sense or anti-sense orientations with reporter plasmids driven by wild-type or mutant CT-elements demonstrates that hnRNP protein K augments gene expression in a cis-element-dependent manner. Taken together, these results suggest that hnRNP protein K may play a role in the transcriptional regulation of the human c-myc gene.},

We sought to determine the overall extent of this feature in cancer and the possibility to use this feature to identify drivers. RESULTS: We have developed OncodriveCLUST, a method to identify genes with a significant bias towards mutation clustering within the protein sequence. This method constructs the background model by assessing coding-silent mutations, which are assumed not to be under positive selection and thus may reflect the baseline tendency of somatic mutations to be clustered. OncodriveCLUST analysis of the Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer retrieved a list of genes enriched by the Cancer Gene Census, prioritizing those with dominant phenotypes but also highlighting some recessive cancer genes, which showed wider but still delimited mutation clusters. Assessment of datasets from The Cancer Genome Atlas demonstrated that OncodriveCLUST selected cancer genes that were nevertheless missed by methods based on frequency and functional impact criteria. This stressed the benefit of combining approaches based on complementary principles to identify driver mutations. We propose OncodriveCLUST as an effective tool for that purpose.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Both the BTK inhibitor ibrutinib and the BCL2 inhibitor venetoclax are active as monotherapy in the treatment of mantle-cell lymphoma. Complete response rates of 21\% have been observed for each agent when administered as long-term continuous therapy. Preclinical models predict synergy in combination. METHODS: We conducted a single-group, phase 2 study of daily oral ibrutinib and venetoclax in patients, as compared with historical controls. Patients commenced ibrutinib monotherapy at a dose of 560 mg per day. After 4 weeks, venetoclax was added in stepwise, weekly increasing doses to 400 mg per day. Both drugs were continued until progression or an unacceptable level of adverse events. The primary end point was the rate of complete response at week 16. Minimal residual disease (MRD) was assessed by flow cytometry in bone marrow and by allele-specific oligonucleotide-polymerase chain reaction (ASO-PCR) in blood. RESULTS: The study included 24 patients with relapsed or refractory mantle-cell lymphoma (23 patients) or previously untreated mantle-cell lymphoma (1 patient). Patients were 47 to 81 years of age, and the number of previous treatments ranged from none to six. Half the patients had aberrations of TP53, and 75\% had a high-risk prognostic score. The complete response rate according to computed tomography at week 16 was 42\%, which was higher than the historical result of 9\% at this time point with ibrutinib monotherapy (P{$<$}0.001). The rate of complete response as assessed by positron-emission tomography was 62\% at week 16 and 71\% overall. MRD clearance was confirmed by flow cytometry in 67\% of the patients and by ASO-PCR in 38\%. In a time-to-event analysis, 78\% of the patients with a response were estimated to have an ongoing response at 15 months. The tumor lysis syndrome occurred in 2 patients. Common side effects were generally low grade and included diarrhea (in 83\% of the patients), fatigue (in 75\%), and nausea or vomiting (in 71\%). CONCLUSIONS: In this study involving historical controls, dual targeting of BTK and BCL2 with ibrutinib and venetoclax was consistent with improved outcomes in patients with mantle-cell lymphoma who had been predicted to have poor outcomes with current therapy.

  abstract = {The majority of non-Hodgkin's B-cell lymphomas contain a t(14;18) translocation that places the bc12 gene into juxtaposition with the transcriptically active Ig heavy-chain locus, thus deregulating the expression of this proto-oncogene. The bc12 gene product is a membrane-associated mitochondrial protein that regulates cell survival through unknown mechanisms. Although overproduction of the normal protein appears sufficient for conferring a selective growth or survival advantage to B cells, point mutations that alter the coding region of translocated bc12 genes have been described previously by others in a lymphoma cell line. However, it is not known whether somatic mutations that alter BCL2 proteins occur in vivo or whether they result from chemotherapy or arise through other mechanisms. For these reasons, we obtained DNA from the t(14;18)-containing tumors of five patients who had not undergone treatment for their disease, and used a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-mismatch technique for rapid identification of point mutations in a portion of the bc12 open reading frame (ORF) corresponding to the first 131 aminoacids (aa) of the 239 aa p26 BCL2 protein. DNAs from two t(14;18)-containing cell lines were also analyzed. Point mutations in this region of the bc12 gene ORF were detected in three of five patients' tumors and in both cell lines. PCR-mismatch analysis of bc12 in cell lines and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma cases that lacked the t(14;18) translocation was negative, thus establishing the specificity of these results. DNA sequencing determined that these mutations are predicted to produce aa substitutions in the BCL2 proteins of two of the primary tumors and one of the cell lines. Interestingly, two of the patients contained an identical C----T transition that resulted in a nonconservative aa substitution (proline----serine) at position 59 of the BCL2 protein. Further analysis excluded the possibility that these mutations represented hereditary polymorphisms or PCR artifacts. A cluster of four point mutations within the translocation + bc12 allele of one patient had hallmarks of the somatic hypermutation mechanism that is associated with Ig genes and that contributes to antibody diversity. Because of the region of the bcl2 gene analyzed in these t(14;18) translocations is located nearly 300 kbp from the Ig heavy-chain locus, our data suggest that the Ig gene somatic hypermutation mechanism can act over extreme distances of DNA. It remains to be established whether these somatic mutations that alter BCL2 proteins influence the pathobiology of nonHodgkin's lymphomas.},

  abstract = {HNRNPA2B1, an RNA-binding protein, plays a key role in primary microRNA processing, alternative splicing, mRNA metabolism and transport. Interestingly, hnRNPA2B1 also works as an N6-methyladenosine (m6A) reader and is critical during tumorigenesis of various tissue types. However, its role in colon cancer is still unclear. In this study, we aimed to elucidate the biological functions of hnRNPA2B1 and to explore its underlying mechanisms in colon cancer. We examined the expression of hnRNPA2B1 in Oncomine and TCGA databases. Then verified the findings in colon cancer cells and clinical samples with western blotting and immunohistochemistry (IHC). We used CRISPR/Cas9 directed gene editing to knockout hnRNPA2B1 expression in human colon cancer cell line SW480 and HCT-116 and carried out both in vivo and in vitro experiments. The results were further confirmed by RNA-seq analyses. We found that hnRNPA2B1 significantly promoted colon cancer cell proliferation both in vitro and in vivo, while knockout of hnRNPA2B1 induced apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in SW480. RNA-seq analyses revealed that the ERK/MAPK pathway was activated by hnRNPA2B1 upregulation. In addition, both hnRNPA2B1 and MAPK pathway were activated in clinical colon cancer specimens and positively correlated. Mechanistically, hnRNPA2B1 appeared to be an upstream regulator of the ERK/MAPK pathway and inhibition of MAPK signaling blocked the effects of hnRNPA2B1. Taken together, our data demonstrated that the RNA-binding protein hnRNPA2B1 promotes cell proliferation and regulates cell cycle and apoptosis of human colon cancer by activating the ERK/MAPK signaling, which may provide a new insight into the development of hnRNPA2B1 as a potential therapeutic target for treatment of colon cancer.}

We quantitatively studied the B1 expression in 85 lymph node specimens, comprising reactive lymphoid hyperplasia (RLH; n=8), B-cell lymphoma (n=23), T-cell lymphoma (n=22), and metastatic carcinoma (n=32). Immunostaining and immunoblotting analyses with an anti-B1 monoclonal antibody, 2B2 were performed, and the two sets of results correlated with each other (p{$<$}0.05). In RLH specimens, B1 expression rate was significantly higher in follicular centers (FC; 44\%) than in mantle zone (MZ; 15\%) and paracortex (16\%) (p{$<$}0.01). B1 expression was statistically higher in B-cell lymphoma than in T-cell lymphoma (p{$<$}0.01). In B-cell lymphomas, B1 expression rates were 51\% in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBL; n=5) and 45\% in follicular lymphoma (FL; n=16), and they were almost the same as that of the FC. Especially in DLBLs, CD10+ FC-origin lymphomas expressed greater amount of B1 than CD10- non-FC-origin lymphomas. B1 expression rate was low in mantle cell lymphoma (MCL; n=2) and similar to that of MZ in RLH. These results suggest that B1 expression is associated with differentiation in lymphoid tissue rather than transformation. B1 expression increases during the process of B-cell differentiation in the FC, and that high B1 expression is maintained in B-cell lymphomagenesis, especially in cells of FC-origin DLBL.}

In ATLL cases, scattered large transformed lymphoma cells demonstrated strong B1 expression, while the medium-sized lymphoma cells were negative. On the one hand, lymphoma cells in AILD diffusely expressed B1. The mean B1 expression rate in ATLL was 22\%, which was significantly lower than that in AILDs (45\%), B-cell lymphomas (44\%), and metastatic carcinomas (53\%) (p{$<$}0.01).

The final assembly was 2.33 Gb with a scaffold N50 of 36.7 Mb, and the genome is of comparable size to that of its close relative the polar bear (2.30 Gb). An analysis using 4104 highly conserved mammalian genes indicated that 96.1\% were found to be complete within the assembly. An automated annotation of the genome identified 19,848 protein coding genes. Our study shows that the combination of the two sequencing modalities that we used is sufficient for the construction of highly contiguous reference quality mammalian genomes.

  abstract = {Mutations or deletions in TP53 or ATM are well-known determinants of poor prognosis in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), but only account for approximately 40\% of chemo-resistant patients. Genome-wide sequencing has uncovered novel mutations in the splicing factor sf3b1, that were in part associated with ATM aberrations, suggesting functional synergy. We first performed detailed genetic analyses in a CLL cohort (n=110) containing ATM, SF3B1 and TP53 gene defects. Next, we applied a newly developed multiplex assay for p53/ATM target gene induction and measured apoptotic responses to DNA damage. Interestingly, SF3B1 mutated samples without concurrent ATM and TP53 aberrations (sole SF3B1) displayed partially defective ATM/p53 transcriptional and apoptotic responses to various DNA-damaging regimens. In contrast, NOTCH1 or K/N-RAS mutated CLL displayed normal responses in p53/ATM target gene induction and apoptosis. In sole SF3B1 mutated cases, ATM kinase function remained intact, and γH2AX formation, a marker for DNA damage, was increased at baseline and upon irradiation. Our data demonstrate that single mutations in sf3b1 are associated with increased DNA damage and/or an aberrant response to DNA damage. Together, our observations may offer an explanation for the poor prognosis associated with SF3B1 mutations.},

RESULTS: Here we perform a combined analysis of three major breast cancer microarray data sets to hone in on a universally valid prognostic molecular classifier in estrogen receptor (ER) positive tumors. Using a recently developed robust measure of prognostic separation, we further validate the prognostic classifier in three external independent cohorts, confirming the validity of our molecular classifier in a total of 877 ER positive samples. Furthermore, we find that molecular classifiers may not outperform classical prognostic indices but that they can be used in hybrid molecular-pathological classification schemes to improve prognostic separation. CONCLUSION: The prognostic molecular classifier presented here is the first to be valid in over 877 ER positive breast cancer samples and across three different microarray platforms. Larger multi-institutional studies will be needed to fully determine the added prognostic value of molecular classifiers when combined with standard prognostic factors.},

  abstract = {The pathogenesis of classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL), the most common lymphoma in the young, is still enigmatic, largely because its Hodgkin and Reed-Sternberg (HRS) tumor cells are rare in the involved lymph node and therefore difficult to analyze. Here, by overcoming this technical challenge and performing, for the first time, a genome-wide transcriptional analysis of microdissected HRS cells compared with other B-cell lymphomas, cHL lines, and normal B-cell subsets, we show that they differ extensively from the usually studied cHL cell lines, that the lost B-cell identity of cHLs is not linked to the acquisition of a plasma cell-like gene expression program, and that Epstein-Barr virus infection of HRS cells has a minor transcriptional influence on the established cHL clone. Moreover, although cHL appears a distinct lymphoma entity overall, HRS cells of its histologic subtypes diverged in their similarity to other related lymphomas. Unexpectedly, we identified 2 molecular subgroups of cHL associated with differential strengths of the transcription factor activity of the NOTCH1, MYC, and IRF4 proto-oncogenes. Finally, HRS cells display deregulated expression of several genes potentially highly relevant to lymphoma pathogenesis, including silencing of the apoptosis-inducer BIK and of INPP5D, an inhibitor of the PI3K-driven oncogenic pathway.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Hairy-cell leukemia (HCL) is a well-defined clinicopathological entity whose underlying genetic lesion is still obscure. METHODS: We searched for HCL-associated mutations by performing massively parallel sequencing of the whole exome of leukemic and matched normal cells purified from the peripheral blood of an index patient with HCL. Findings were validated by Sanger sequencing in 47 additional patients with HCL. RESULTS: Whole-exome sequencing identified five missense somatic clonal mutations that were confirmed on Sanger sequencing, including a heterozygous mutation in BRAF that results in the BRAF V600E variant protein. Since BRAF V600E is oncogenic in other tumors, further analyses were focused on this genetic lesion. The same BRAF mutation was noted in all the other 47 patients with HCL who were evaluated by means of Sanger sequencing. None of the 195 patients with other peripheral B-cell lymphomas or leukemias who were evaluated carried the BRAF V600E variant, including 38 patients with splenic marginal-zone lymphomas or unclassifiable splenic lymphomas or leukemias. In immunohistologic and Western blot studies, HCL cells expressed phosphorylated MEK and ERK (the downstream targets of the BRAF kinase), indicating a constitutive activation of the RAF-MEK-ERK mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway in HCL. In vitro incubation of BRAF-mutated primary leukemic hairy cells from 5 patients with PLX-4720, a specific inhibitor of active BRAF, led to a marked decrease in phosphorylated ERK and MEK. CONCLUSIONS; The BRAF V600E mutation was present in all patients with HCL who were evaluated. This finding may have implications for the pathogenesis, diagnosis, and targeted therapy of HCL.

Mutations of STAT6 genetically and functionally cooperated with disruption of SOCS1, a JAK-STAT pathway inhibitor, to promote cHL growth. Overall, 87\% of cases showed dysregulation of the JAK-STAT pathway by genetic alterations in multiple genes (also including STAT3, STAT5B, JAK1, JAK2, and PTPN1), attesting to the pivotal role of this pathway in cHL pathogenesis and highlighting its potential as a new therapeutic target in this disease.},

However, only 60\% of patients are cured with R-CHOP. Polatuzumab vedotin is an antibody-drug conjugate targeting CD79b, which is ubiquitously expressed on the surface of malignant B cells. METHODS: We conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled, international phase 3 trial to evaluate a modified regimen of R-CHOP (pola-R-CHP), in which vincristine was replaced with polatuzumab vedotin, as compared with standard R-CHOP, in patients with previously untreated intermediate-risk or high-risk DLBCL. Patients 18 to 80 years of age were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive six cycles of either pola-R-CHP or R-CHOP, plus two cycles of rituximab alone. The primary end point was investigator-assessed progression-free survival. Secondary end points included overall survival and safety. RESULTS: Overall, 879 patients underwent randomization: 440 were assigned to the pola-R-CHP group and 439 to the R-CHOP group. After a median follow-up of 28.2 months, the percentage of patients surviving without progression was significantly higher in the pola-R-CHP group than in the R-CHOP group (76.7\% [95\% confidence interval (CI), 72.7 to 80.8] vs. 70.2\% [95\% CI, 65.8 to 74.6] at 2 years; stratified hazard ratio for progression, relapse, or death, 0.73 by Cox regression; 95\% CI, 0.57 to 0.95; P\,=\,0.02). Overall survival at 2 years did not differ significantly between the groups (88.7\% [95\% CI, 85.7 to 91.6] in the pola-R-CHP group and 88.6\% [95\% CI, 85.6 to 91.6] in the R-CHOP group; hazard ratio for death, 0.94; 95\% CI, 0.65 to 1.37; P\,=\,0.75). The safety profile was similar in the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with previously untreated intermediate-risk or high-risk DLBCL, the risk of disease progression, relapse, or death was lower among those who received pola-R-CHP than among those who received R-CHOP.

  abstract = {Alternative splicing (AS) is a major contributor to proteome diversity, but it also regulates gene expression by introducing premature termination codons (PTCs) that destabilize transcripts, typically via the nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) pathway. Such AS events often take place within long, conserved sequence elements, particularly in genes encoding various RNA binding proteins. AS-NMD is often activated by the protein encoded by the same gene, leading to a self-regulating feedback loop that maintains constant protein levels. However, cross-regulation between different RNA binding proteins is also common, giving rise to finely tuned regulatory networks. Recently, we described a feedback mechanism regulating two protein components of the U12-dependent spliceosome (U11-48K and U11/U12-65K) through a highly conserved sequence element. These elements contain a U11 snRNP-binding splicing enhancer (USSE), which, through the U11 snRNP, activates an upstream U2-type 3'ss, resulting in the degradation of the U11-48K mRNA by AS-NMD. Through phylogenetic analysis, we now identify a G-rich sequence element that is conserved in fishes as well as mammals. We show that this element binds hnRNPF/H proteins in vitro. Knockdown of hnRNPH1/H2 or mutations in the G-run both lead to enhanced activation of the 3'ss in vivo, suggesting that hnRNPH1/H2 proteins counteract the 3'ss activation. Furthermore, we provide evidence that U1 binding immediately downstream from the G-run similarly counteracts the U11-mediated activation of the alternative 3'ss. Thus, our results elucidate the mechanism in which snRNPs from both spliceosomes together with hnRNPH1/H2 proteins regulate the recognition and activation of the highly conserved alternative splice sites within the U11-48K pre-mRNA.},

  abstract = {Intron retention (IR) has been proposed to modulate the delay between transcription and translation. Here, we provide an exhaustive characterization of IR in differentiated white blood cells from both the myeloid and lymphoid lineage where we observed highest levels of IR in monocytes and B-cells, in addition to previously reported granulocytes. During B-cell differentiation, we found an increase in IR from the bone marrow precursors to cells residing in secondary lymphoid organs. B-cells that undergo affinity maturation to become antibody producing plasma cells steadily decrease retention. In general, we found an inverse relationship between global IR levels and both the proliferative state of cells, and the global levels of expression of splicing factors. IR dynamics during B-cell differentiation appear to be conserved between human and mouse, suggesting that IR plays an important biological role, evolutionary conserved, during blood cell differentiation. By correlating the expression of non-core splicing factors with global IR levels, and analyzing RNA binding protein knockdown and eCLIP data, we identify a few splicing factors likely playing an evolutionary conserved role in IR regulation. Our work provides new insights into the role of IR during hematopoiesis, and on the main factors involved in regulating IR.}

A variety of genome wide studies have taken advantage of methods like CLIP and RIP to identify the targets and binding sites of RNA binding proteins. However, due to the complex nature of RNA-binding proteins, these studies are incomplete without assays that characterize the impact of RBP binding on mRNA target expression. Here we used a suite of high-throughput approaches (RIP-Seq, iCLIP, RNA-Seq and shotgun proteomics) to provide a comprehensive view of hnRNP H1s ensemble of targets and its role in splicing, mRNA decay, and translation. The combination of RIP-Seq and iCLIP allowed us to identify a set of 1,086 high confidence target transcripts. Binding site motif analysis of these targets suggests the TGGG tetramer as a prevalent component of hnRNP H1 binding motif, with particular enrichment around intronic hnRNP H1 sites. Our analysis of the target transcripts and binding sites indicates that hnRNP H1s involvement in splicing is 2-fold: it directly affects a substantial number of splicing events, but also regulates the expression of major components of the splicing machinery and other RBPs with known roles in splicing regulation. The identified mRNA targets displayed function enrichment in MAPK signaling and ubiquitin mediated proteolysis, which might be main routes by which hnRNP H1 promotes tumorigenesis.},

The central players are the RNA-binding proteins, and experimental technologies [such as cross-linking with immunoprecipitation- (CLIP-) and RIP-seq] for probing their activities have advanced rapidly over the course of the past decade. Statistically robust, flexible computational methods for binding site identification from high-throughput immunoprecipitation assays are largely lacking however. RESULTS: We introduce a method for site identification which provides four key advantages over previous methods: (i) it can be applied on all variations of CLIP and RIP-seq technologies, (ii) it accurately models the underlying read-count distributions, (iii) it allows external covariates, such as transcript abundance (which we demonstrate is highly correlated with read count) to inform the site identification process and (iv) it allows for direct comparison of site usage across cell types or conditions.

Both the insertion breakpoint at 14q32 and the deletion breakpoint at 18q21 were cloned using inverse polymerase chain reaction. Sequence analysis showed that the JH sequences were juxtaposed to the 5′-side of BCL2, and the DH sequences were juxtaposed to the 3′-side of BCL2. There were breakpoints at both the JH and DH recombination signal sequences, and N-nucleotides were present at all breakpoint junctions. At theBCL2 locus, the 3′-breakpoints in both cases were localized at exactly the same nucleotide position, 6.2 kilobase downstream of the major breakpoint region, directly adjacent to a complete cryptic recombination signal sequence (RSS) consisting of a heptamer, a nonamer, and a 23–base pair (bp) spacer. The BCL25′-breakpoints were approximately 600 bp upstream of the gene, within the CA repeats. Although less evident than for the BCL23′-breakpoints, cryptic RSSs were also identified at these breakpoints, with a 12-bp spacer. On the basis of structural characteristics of these rearrangements, a model is proposed in which the BCL2 gene is deleted from its locus by recombination activation gene-1/-2 (RAG-1/-2)–mediated excision. The gene is subsequently inserted into the recombiningIGH locus, a process involving the formation of hybrid joints between the IGH coding ends and theBCL2 signal ends.}

This study represents an initiative of the ACVP Oncology Committee, and the classification has been endorsed by the World Small Animal Veterinary Association (WASVA). Tissue biopsies from cases of canine lymphoma were received from veterinary oncologists, and a study by pathologists given only signalment was carried out on 300 cases. Twenty pathologists reviewed these 300 cases with each required to choose a diagnosis from a list of 43 B and T cell lymphomas. Three of the 20 were hematopathologists who determined the consensus diagnosis for each case. The 17 who formed the test group were experienced but not specialists in hematopathology, and most were diplomates of the American or European Colleges of Veterinary Pathology. The overall accuracy of the 17 pathologists on the 300 cases was 83\%. When the analysis was limited to the 6 most common diagnoses, containing 80\% of all cases, accuracy rose to 87\%. In a test of reproducibility enabled by reintroducing 5\% of cases entered under a different identity, the overall agreement between the first and second diagnosis ranged from 40 to 87\%. The statistical review included 43,000 data points for each of the 20 pathologists.},

METHODS AND RESULTS: Nodal marginal zone lymphomas were diagnosed according to strict criteria, including the expression of at least one putative marginal zone marker (MNDA and/or IRTA1). Cases that showed features of NMZL but did not fulfil all criteria were included as BCL-u. All FLs were required to have a BCL2 rearrangement. Mutations were found in: nine NMZLs, with recurrent mutations in TNFAIP3 and CD79B; 12 FLs, with recurrent mutations in TNFRSF14, TNFAIP3, and CARD11; and five cases of BCL-u, with recurrent mutations in TNFRSF14. TNFRSF14 mutations were present in FL and BCL-u, but not in any of the NMZLs. In the BCL-u group, TNFRSF14 mutations clustered with a FL immunophenotype. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that TNFRSF14 mutations point towards a diagnosis of FL, and can be used in the sometimes difficult distinction between NMZL and FL, but to apply this in diagnostics would require confirmation in an independent cohort. In addition, the presence or absence of specific mutations in pathways converging on NF-κB could be important for decisions regarding targeted treatment.},

While DDX3X is ubiquitously expressed in human tissues and essential for viability, DDX3Y is male-specific and shows lower and more variable expression than DDX3X in somatic tissues. Heterozygous genetic lesions in DDX3X mediate a class of developmental disorders called DDX3X syndrome, while loss of DDX3Y is implicated in male infertility. One possible explanation for female-bias in DDX3X syndrome is that DDX3Y encodes a polypeptide with different biochemical activity. In this study, we use ribosome profiling and in vitro translation to demonstrate that the X- and Y-linked paralogs of DDX3 play functionally redundant roles in translation. We find that transcripts that are sensitive to DDX3X depletion or mutation are rescued by complementation with DDX3Y. Our data indicate that DDX3X and DDX3Y proteins can functionally complement each other in the context of mRNA translation in human cells. DDX3Y is not expressed in a large fraction of the central nervous system. These findings suggest that expression differences, not differences in paralog-dependent protein synthesis, underlie the sex-bias of DDX3X-associated diseases.},

The majority of mutations (11/21; 52\%) were hotspot single nucleotide variants in exon 8, leading to an I242N amino acid change in the transmembrane domain. Functional analyses establish this mutation as gain of function leading to constitutive activation of the JAK-STAT pathway and upregulation of downstream cytokine expression profiles and B cell-specific antigens. Moreover, expression of I242N mutant IL4R in a mouse xenotransplantation model conferred growth advantage in vivo. The pattern of concurrent mutations within the JAK-STAT signaling pathway suggests additive/synergistic effects of these gene mutations contributing to lymphomagenesis. Our data establish IL4R mutations as novel driver alterations and provide a strong preclinical rationale for therapeutic targeting of JAK-STAT signaling in PMBCL.},

The binding partners of the RNA G-quadruplexes we discovered included several heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins, ribosomal proteins, and splicing factors, as well as other proteins that have previously not been described to interact with nucleic acids. While most of the proteins were specific for either of the investigated G-quadruplexes, some of them bound to both motifs. Selected candidate proteins were subsequently produced by recombinant expression and dissociation constants for the interaction between the proteins and RNA G-quadruplexes in the low nanomolar range were determined by surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy. The present study may thus help to increase our understanding of the mechanisms by which G-quadruplexes regulate translation.},

  abstract = {Disease Overview Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) is a non-Hodgkin lymphoma characterized by involvement of the lymph nodes, spleen, blood and bone marrow with a short remission duration to standard therapies and a median overall survival (OS) of 4-5 years. Diagnosis Diagnosis is based on lymph node, bone marrow, or tissue morphology of centrocytic lymphocytes, small cell type, or blastoid variant cells. A chromosomal translocation t (11:14) is the molecular hallmark of MCL, resulting in the overexpression of cyclin D1. Cyclin D1 is detected by immunohistochemistry in 98\% of cases. The absence of SOX-11 or a low Ki-67 may correlate with a more indolent form of MCL. The differential diagnosis of MCL includes small lymphocytic lymphoma, marginal zone lymphoma, and follicular lymphoma. Risk Stratification The MCL International Prognostic Index (MIPI) is the prognostic model most often used and incorporates ECOG performance status, age, leukocyte count, and lactic dehydrogenase. A modification of the MIPI also adds the Ki-67 proliferative index if available. The median OS for the low-risk group was not reached (5-year OS of 60\%). The median OS for the intermediate risk group was 51 months and 29 months for the high risk group. Risk-Adapted Therapy For selected indolent, low MIPI MCL patients, initial observation may be appropriate therapy. For younger patients with intermediate or high risk MIPI MCL, aggressive therapy with a cytotoxic Regimen followed by autologous stem cell transplantation should be considered. Rituximab maintenance after autologous stem cell transplantation has also improved the progression-free and overall survival. For older symptomatic MCL patients with intermediate or high risk MIPI, combination chemotherapy with R-CHOP, R-Bendamustine, or a clinical trial should be considered. In addition, rituximab maintenance therapy may prolong the progression-free survival. At the time of relapse, agents directed at activated pathways in MCL cells such as bortezomib (NFkB inhibitor), lenalidamide (anti-angiogenesis) and Ibruitinib (Bruton's Tyrosine Kinase [BTK] inhibitor) have demonstrated excellent clinical activity in MCL patients. Autologous or allogeneic stem cell transplantation can also be considered in young patients. Clinical trials with novel agents are always a consideration for MCL patients.},

Primary intraocular lymphoma (PIOL) is a diffuse large B cell lymphoma that initially infiltrates the retina, vitreous, or optic nerve head, with or without central nervous system involvement. This study examined the expression of the bcl-2 t(14;18) translocation, the bcl-10 gene, and high expression of bcl-6 mRNA in PIOL cells.  methods. Microdissection and PCR analysis were used to examine vitreous specimens in patients with PIOL for the presence of bcl-2 t(14;18) translocations, the bcl-10 gene, and expression of bcl-6 mRNA. A medical record review was also conducted to determine whether the bcl-2 t(14;18) translocation correlated with prognosis.  results. Forty of 72 (55\%) PIOL patients expressed the bcl-2 t(14;18) translocation at the major breakpoint region. Fifteen of 68 (22\%) patients expressed the translocation at the minor cluster region. The bcl-10 gene was detected in 6 of 26 (23\%) patients, whereas 4 of 4 (100\%) PIOL patients expressed higher levels of bcl-6 mRNA compared with inflammatory lymphocytes. An analysis of clinical outcome in 23 PIOL patients revealed no significant association between bcl-2 t(14;18) translocations and survival or relapse. However, patients with the translocation were significantly younger.  conclusions. PIOL has unique molecular patterns of bcl-2, bcl-10, and bcl-6 when compared with other systemic lymphomas. This study lays the foundation for future studies aimed at exploring the genotypic classification of PIOL based on the quantitative molecular framework of gene expression profiling, with the goal of providing useful adjuncts to the pathologic diagnosis of this complex disease.}

As a component of an mRNA export complex, hnRNP H shuttles mature mRNA from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. Although hnRNP H is primarily a nuclear protein, it can accumulate in the cytoplasm in certain tissues and cell types; however, the physiological relevance of hnRNP H cytoplasmic accumulation is unknown. Here we show that under cellular stress hnRNP H accumulates in the cytoplasm and is required for efficient recovery from cellular stress. Moreover, we find that cytoplasmic hnRNP H localizes to stress granules and that the RRM3 domain of hnRNP H is necessary for this localization. Together, our results demonstrate that hnRNP H accumulates in the cytoplasm under cellular stress and is recruited to stress granules.},

  abstract = {Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein K (hnRNPK) is an DNA/RNA-binding protein and regulates a wide range of biological processes and disease pathogenesis. It contains 3 K-homologous (KH) domains, which are conserved in other RNA-binding proteins, mediate nucleic acid binding activity, and function as an enhancer or repressor of gene transcription. Phosphorylation of the protein alters its regulatory function, which also enables the protein to serve as a docking platform for the signal transduction proteins. In terms of the function of hnRNPK, it is central to many cellular events, including long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) regulation, cancer development and bone homoeostasis. Many studies have identified hnRNPK as an oncogene, where it is overexpressed in cancer tissues compared with the nonneoplastic tissues and its expression level is related to the prognosis of different types of host malignancies. However, hnRNPK has also been identified as a tumour suppressor, as it is important for the activation of the p53/p21 pathway. Recently, the protein is also found to be exclusively related to the regulation of paraspeckles and lncRNAs such as Neat1, Lncenc1 and Xist. Interestingly, hnRNPK has been found to associate with the Kabuki-like syndrome and Au-Kline syndrome with prominent skeletal abnormalities. In vitro study revealed that the hnRNPK protein is essential for the formation of osteoclast, in line with its importance in the skeletal system.},

We have performed a genome-wide transcriptomic analysis at the gene and exon levels in Oli-neu cells treated with siRNA that targets hnRNPH/F compared to untreated cells using Affymetrix Exon Array. Gene expression levels and regulated exons were identified with the GenoSplice EASANA algorithm. Bioinformatics analyses were performed to determine the structural properties of G tracts that correlate with the function of hnRNPH/F as enhancers vs. repressors of exon inclusion. Different types of alternatively spliced events are regulated by hnRNPH/F. Intronic G tracts density, length and proximity to the 5' splice site correlate with the hnRNPH/F enhancer function. Additionally, 6\% of genes are differently expressed upon knock down of hnRNPH/F. Genes that regulate the transition of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells to oligodendrocytes are differentially expressed in hnRNPH/F depleted Oli-neu cells, resulting in a decrease of negative regulators and an increase of differentiation-inducing regulators. The changes were confirmed in developing oligodendrocytes in vivo. This is the first genome wide analysis of splicing events and gene expression regulated by hnRNPH/F in oligodendrocytes and the first report that hnRNPH/F regulate genes that are involved in the transition from oligodendrocyte progenitor cells to oligodendrocytes.},

We sought to define the rate and outcome of late relapses that occurred after achieving event-free survival at 24 months (EFS24). METHODS: We prospectively followed 1,324 patients with newly diagnosed DLBCL from 2002 to 2015 and treated with immunochemotherapy. Cumulative incidences of late DLBCL and indolent lymphoma relapses were analyzed as competing events. Postrelapse survival was defined as time from first relapse to death from any cause. RESULTS: In 847 patients who achieved EFS24, the cumulative incidence of late relapse was 6.9\% at 3 years, 9.3\% at 5 years, and 10.3\% at 8 years after EFS24. The incidence of DLBCL relapse was similar in patients with DLBCL alone at diagnosis (6.3\% at 5 years), compared with patients with concurrent indolent lymphoma at diagnosis (5.2\%; P = .46). However, the rate of indolent lymphoma relapse was higher in patients with concurrent indolent lymphoma (7.4\% v 2.1\% at 5 years; P {$<$} .01). In patients with DLBCL alone, the rate of DLBCL relapse was similar in the germinal center B-cell-like (GCB) (4.1\% at 5 years) and non-GCB (4.0\%; P = .71) subtypes, whereas the rate of indolent lymphoma relapse was higher in patients with the GCB subtype (3.9\% v 0.0\% at 5 years; P = .02). Postrelapse survival was inferior for patients who relapsed with DLBCL than for those who relapsed with indolent lymphoma (median 29.9 months v unreached; P {$<$} .01). CONCLUSION: Patients with DLBCL with a concurrent indolent lymphoma and those with the GCB subtype had a higher rate of late relapse, owing to increased relapses with indolent lymphoma. Patients who relapsed with DLBCL had a worse prognosis than those who relapsed with indolent lymphoma.},

The ubiquitin ligase F-box and WD repeat domain-containing 7 (FBXW7) is recognized as a tumor suppressor in many cancer types. Methods: Firstly, we determined the FBXW7 mutation frequency (n = 120) and mRNA expression (n = 87) in a collection of human iCCA. Based on the preliminary findings in human data, we generated a mouse model by hydrodynamic tail vein injection of activated/myristylated (myr-)AKT with Fbxw7ΔF, a dominant negative form of Fbxw7. Subsequently, we investigated the role of established targets of Fbxw7, namely Notch2, Yap, and c-Myc in this novel mouse model and in human CCA cell lines. Results: FBXW7 mRNA expression is almost ubiquitously downregulated (71/82; 86.6\%) in human iCCA specimens, while only 0.8\% of samples showed FBXW7 somatic mutations. In vivo, co-expression of AKT and Fbxw7ΔF triggered the development of iCCA lesions and mice were euthanized by 15 weeks post-injection due to high tumor burden. At the molecular level, a strong induction of FBXW7 canonical targets, including Yap, Notch2, and c-Myc oncoproteins, was detected. However, only c-Myc was consistently confirmed as a FBXW7 target in human CCA cell lines. Interestingly, selected ablation of c-Myc completely impaired iCCA formation in AKT/Fbxw7ΔF mice, whereas deletion of either Yap or Notch2 delayed cholangiocarcinogenesis in the same model. Furthermore, in human iCCA specimens, a strong, inverse correlation between the expression levels of FBXW7 and c-Myc was observed. Conclusions: Downregulation of FBXW7 is almost ubiquitous in human iCCA and cooperates with AKT to induce cholangiocarcinogenesis in mice. This pre-clinical mouse model could be used to test novel therapeutics targeting c-Myc, Notch2, and/or Yap.},

Around 15 000 years ago, a subset of ancestral dogs started migrating to the Middle East, Africa and Europe, arriving in Europe at about 10 000 years ago. One of the out of Asia lineages also migrated back to the east, creating a series of admixed populations with the endemic Asian lineages in northern China before migrating to the New World.

METHODS: We obtained DNA samples from leukemia cells in 91 patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia and performed massively parallel sequencing of 88 whole exomes and whole genomes, together with sequencing of matched germline DNA, to characterize the spectrum of somatic mutations in this disease. RESULTS: Nine genes that are mutated at significant frequencies were identified, including four with established roles in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (TP53 in 15\% of patients, ATM in 9\%, MYD88 in 10\%, and NOTCH1 in 4\%) and five with unestablished roles (SF3B1, ZMYM3, MAPK1, FBXW7, and DDX3X). SF3B1, which functions at the catalytic core of the spliceosome, was the second most frequently mutated gene (with mutations occurring in 15\% of patients). SF3B1 mutations occurred primarily in tumors with deletions in chromosome 11q, which are associated with a poor prognosis in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia. We further discovered that tumor samples with mutations in SF3B1 had alterations in pre-messenger RNA (mRNA) splicing. CONCLUSIONS: Our study defines the landscape of somatic mutations in chronic lymphocytic leukemia and highlights pre-mRNA splicing as a critical cellular process contributing to chronic lymphocytic leukemia.},

  abstract = {Follicular lymphoma (FL) is an indolent cancer of mature B-cells but with ongoing risk of transformation to more aggressive histology over time. Recurrent mutations associated with transformation have been identified; however, prognostic features that can be discerned at diagnosis could be clinically useful. We present here comprehensive profiling of both tumor and immune compartments in 155 diagnostic FL biopsies at single-cell resolution by mass cytometry. This revealed a diversity of phenotypes but included two recurrent patterns, one which closely resembles germinal center B-cells (GCB) and another which appears more related to memory B-cells (MB). GCB-type tumors are enriched for EZH2, TNFRSF14, and MEF2B mutations, while MB-type tumors contain increased follicular helper T-cells. MB-type and intratumoral phenotypic diversity are independently associated with increased risk of transformation, supporting biological relevance of these features. Notably, a reduced 26-marker panel retains sufficient information to allow phenotypic profiling of future cohorts by conventional flow cytometry.},

  abstract = {In eukaryotic cells, messenger RNAs are formed by extensive posttranscriptional processing of primary transcripts, assembled with a large number of proteins and processing factors in ribonucleoprotein complexes. The protein moiety of these complexes mainly constitutes a class of about 20 major polypeptides called heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins or hnRNPs. The function and the mechanism of action of hnRNPs is still not fully understood, but the identification of RNA binding domains and RNA binding specificities, and the development of new functional assays, has stimulated interest in them. In contrast to previous models that hypothesised a mere structural (histone-like) function, a more diversified and dynamic role for these proteins is now emerging. In fact, they can be viewed as a subset of the trans-acting pre-mRNA maturation factors. They might actively participate in post-transcriptional events such as regulated splicing and mRNA export. Moreover, recent data suggest an involvement of some of these proteins in molecular diseases. Here we present an overview of the most relevant properties of hnRNPs and discuss some emerging ideas on theiir roles.},

  abstract = {Myc proteins regulate cell growth and division and are implicated in a wide range of human cancers. We show here that Fbw7, a component of the SCFFbw7 ubiquitin ligase and a tumor suppressor, promotes proteasome-dependent c-Myc turnover in vivo and c-Myc ubiquitination in vitro. Phosphorylation of c-Myc on threonine-58 (T58) by glycogen synthase kinase 3 regulates the binding of Fbw7 to c-Myc as well as Fbw7-mediated c-Myc degradation and ubiquitination. T58 is the most frequent site of c-myc mutations in lymphoma cells, and our findings suggest that c-Myc activation is one of the key oncogenic consequences of Fbw7 loss in cancer. Because Fbw7 mediates the degradation of cyclin E, Notch, and c-Jun, as well as c-Myc, the loss of Fbw7 is likely to elicit profound effects on cell proliferation during tumorigenesis.},

SOCS-1 silencing by aberrant DNA methylation contributes to oncogenesis in various B-cell neoplasias and carcinomas. Recently, we showed an alternative loss of SOCS-1 function due to deleterious SOCS-1 mutations in a major subset of primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma (PMBL) and in the PMBL line MedB-1, and a biallelic SOCS-1 deletion in PMBL line Karpas1106P. For both cell lines our previous data demonstrated retarded JAK2 degradation and sustained phospho-JAK2 action leading to enhanced DNA binding of phospho-STAT5. Here, we analysed SOCS-1 in laser-microdissected Hodgkin and Reed-Sternberg (HRS) cells of classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL). We detected SOCS-1 mutations in HRS cells of eight of 19 cHL samples and in three of five Hodgkin lymphoma (HL)-derived cell lines by sequencing analysis. Moreover, we found a significant association between mutated SOCS-1 of isolated HRS cells and nuclear phospho-STAT5 accumulation in HRS cells of cHL tumor tissue (P {$<$} 0.01). Collectively, these findings support the concept that PMBL and cHL share many overlapping features, and that defective tumor suppressor gene SOCS-1 triggers an oncogenic pathway operative in both lymphomas.},

  abstract = {Epithelial breast malignancies are a group of several disease entities that vary in their biology and response to specific therapies. Historically, classification of different molecular types of breast cancer was done through the use of conventional methods such as tumor morphology, grade, and immunophenotyping for estrogen, progesterone, and HER-2/neu receptor expression. Such techniques, although helpful, are not sufficient to accurately predict biologic behavior of breast cancers. Over the last several years, much progress has been made in more precise identification of molecular breast cancer subtypes. Such advances hold a great promise in improving estimation of prognosis and assigning most appropriate therapies. Thanks to use of cDNA microarrays expression technology and quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), tumors with specific gene expression patterns can now be identified. This process is presently reshaping perceptions of how breast cancer should be classified and treated. Categorization of breast cancers by gene expression is only beginning to make its way into the daily clinical practice and likely will complement, but not replace, the conventional methods of classification.},

We used the Pan-Cancer Analysis of Whole Genomes cohort as a test case to construct such a framework. This cohort contains whole cancer genomes of 2832 donors from 18 sequencing centres. We developed a non-redundant set of five quality control (QC) measurements to establish a star rating system. These QC measures reflect known differences in sequencing protocol and provide a guide to downstream analyses and allow for exclusion of samples of poor quality. We have found that this is an effective framework of quality measures. The implementation of the framework is available at: https://dockstore.org/containers/quay.io/jwerner\_dkfz/pancanqc:1.2.2.},

  abstract = {Classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL) is composed of rare malignant Hodgkin Reed-Sternberg (HRS) cells within an extensive, but ineffective, inflammatory/immune cell infiltrate. HRS cells exhibit near-universal somatic copy gains of chromosome 9p/9p24.1, which increase expression of the programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) ligands. To define genetic mechanisms of response and resistance to PD-1 blockade and identify complementary treatment targets, we performed whole-exome sequencing of flow cytometry-sorted HRS cells from 23 excisional biopsies of newly diagnosed cHLs, including 8 Epstein-Barr virus-positive (EBV+) tumors. We identified significantly mutated cancer candidate genes (CCGs) as well as somatic copy number alterations and structural variations and characterized their contribution to disease-defining immune evasion mechanisms and nuclear factor κB (NF-κB), JAK/STAT, and PI3K signaling pathways. EBV- cHLs had a higher prevalence of genetic alterations in the NF-κB and major histocompatibility complex class I antigen presentation pathways. In this young cHL cohort (median age, 26 years), we identified a predominant mutational signature of spontaneous deamination of cytosine- phosphate-guanines ("Aging"), in addition to apolipoprotein B mRNA editing catalytic polypeptide-like, activation-induced cytidine deaminase, and microsatellite instability (MSI)-associated hypermutation. In particular, the mutational burden in EBV- cHLs was among the highest reported, similar to that of carcinogen-induced tumors. Together, the overall high mutational burden, MSI-associated hypermutation, and newly identified genetic alterations represent additional potential bases for the efficacy of PD-1 blockade in cHL. Of note, recurrent cHL alterations, including B2M, TNFAIP3, STAT6, GNA13, and XPO1 mutations and 2p/2p15, 6p21.32, 6q23.3, and 9p/9p24.1 copy number alterations, were also identified in {$>$}20\% of primary mediastinal B-cell lymphomas, highlighting shared pathogenetic mechanisms in these diseases.},

However, activated myc can initiate ARF-dependent activation of p53 and apoptosis as well. Data derived from cell culture and animal models suggest that the inactivation of the ARF-MDM-2-p53 apoptotic signaling pathway may be a necessary secondary event for the development of BL. This has not been tested in freshly excised BL tissue. We investigated the ARF-MDM-2-p53 pathway in tumor specimen from 24 children with sporadic BL/B-ALL. Direct sequencing revealed a point mutation in the p53 gene in four BL. Overexpression of MDM-2 was evident in 10 of the BL samples analyzed by real-time quantitative PCR. Deletion of the CDKN2A locus that encodes ARF or reduced expression of ARF could not be detected in any BL by fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis or real-time quantitative PCR, respectively. Our results indicate that the ARF-MDM-2-p53 apoptotic pathway is disrupted in about 55\% of the cases of childhood sporadic BL. We suggest that in addition to the inactivation of the ARF-MDM-2-p53 protective checkpoint function other antiapoptotic mutations may occur in a substantial part of children with sporadic BL.},

Although the core differentiation program is conserved in all mature B cells, subset-specific regulators, such as those found in B1 or memory B cells, provide additional complexity.

  abstract = {FAM3C/Interleukin-like EMT Inducer (ILEI) is an oncogenic member of the FAM3 cytokine family and serves essential roles in both epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and breast cancer metastasis. ILEI expression levels are regulated through a non-canonical TGFβ signaling pathway by 3’-UTR-mediated translational silencing at the mRNA level by hnRNP E1. TGFβ stimulation or silencing of hnRNP E1 increases ILEI translation and induces an EMT program that correlates to enhanced invasion and migration. Recently, EMT has been linked to the formation of breast cancer stem cells (BCSCs) that confer both tumor cell heterogeneity as well as chemoresistant properties. Herein, we demonstrate that hnRNP E1 knockdown significantly shifts normal mammary epithelial cells to mesenchymal BCSCs in vitro and in vivo. We further validate that modulating ILEI protein levels results in the abrogation of these phenotypes, promoting further investigation into the unknown mechanism of ILEI signaling that drives tumor progression. We identify LIFR as the receptor for ILEI, which mediates signaling through STAT3 to drive both EMT and BCSC formation. Reduction of either ILEI or LIFR protein levels results in reduced tumor growth, fewer tumor initiating cells and reduced metastasis within the hnRNP E1 knock-down cell populations in vivo. These results reveal a novel ligand-receptor complex that drives the formation of BCSCs and represents a unique target for the development of metastatic breast cancer therapies.},

  abstract = {To classify cancer specimens by their gene expression profiles, we created a statistical method based on Bayes' rule that estimates the probability of membership in one of two cancer subgroups. We used this method to classify diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) biopsy samples into two gene expression subgroups based on data obtained from spotted cDNA microarrays. The germinal center B cell-like (GCB) DLBCL subgroup expressed genes characteristic of normal germinal center B cells whereas the activated B cell-like (ABC) DLBCL subgroup expressed a subset of the genes that are characteristic of plasma cells, particularly those encoding endoplasmic reticulum and golgi proteins involved in secretion. We next used this predictor to discover these subgroups within a second set of DLBCL biopsies that had been profiled by using oligonucleotide microarrays [Shipp, M. A., et al. (2002) Nat. Med. 8, 68–74]. The GCB and ABC DLBCL subgroups identified in this data set had significantly different 5-yr survival rates after multiagent chemotherapy (62\% vs. 26\%; P ≤ 0.0051), in accord with analyses of other DLBCL cohorts. These results demonstrate the ability of this gene expression-based predictor to classify DLBCLs into biologically and clinically distinct subgroups irrespective of the method used to measure gene expression.},

Whole-exome sequencing was performed in 27 MCL samples from 13 patients, representing the largest analyzed series of consecutive biopsies obtained at diagnosis and/or relapse for this type of lymphoma. Eighteen genes were found to be recurrently mutated in these samples, including known (ATM, MEF2B and MLL2) and novel mutation targets (S1PR1 and CARD11). CARD11, a scaffold protein required for B-cell receptor (BCR)-induced NF-κB activation, was subsequently screened in an additional 173 MCL samples and mutations were observed in 5.5\% of cases. Based on in vitro cell line-based experiments, overexpression of CARD11 mutants were demonstrated to confer resistance to the BCR-inhibitor ibrutinib and NF-κB-inhibitor lenalidomide. Genetic alterations acquired in the relapse samples were found to be largely non-recurrent, in line with the branched evolutionary pattern of clonal evolution observed in most cases. In summary, this study highlights the genetic heterogeneity in MCL, in particular at relapse, and provides for the first time genetic evidence of BCR/NF-κB activation in a subset of MCL.},

Further structural and biochemical results demonstrate multivariant binding modes for sequence-diversified RNA substrates, supporting a RNA matchmaker mechanism in hnRNP A2/B1 function. Moreover, our studies in combination with bioinformatic analysis suggest that hnRNP A2/B1 may mediate effects of m6A through a “m6A switch” mechanism, instead of acting as a direct “reader” of m6A modification.},

  abstract = {RNA binding proteins (RBPs) are increasingly appreciated as being essential for normal hematopoiesis and have a critical role in the progression of hematological malignancies. However, their functional consequences and clinical significance in diffuse large B‐cell lymphoma (DLBCL) remain unknown. Here, we conducted a systematic analysis to identify RBP‐related genes affecting DLBCL prognosis based on the Gene Expression Omnibus database. By univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression (CPHR) methods, six RBPs‐related genes (CMSS1, MAEL, THOC5, PSIP1, SNIP1, and ZCCHC7) were identified closely related to the overall survival (OS) of DLBCL patients. The RBPs signature could efficiently distinguished low‐risk from high‐risk patients and could serve as an independent and reliable factor for predicting OS. Moreover, Gene Set Enrichment Analysis revealed 17 significantly enriched pathways between high‐ versus low‐risk group, including the regulation of autophagy, chronic myeloid leukemia, NOTCH signaling pathway, and B cell receptor signaling pathway. Then we developed an RBP‐based nomogram combining other clinical risk factors. The receiver operating characteristic curve analysis demonstrated high prognostic predictive efficiency of this model with the area under the curve values were 0.820 and 0.780, respectively, in the primary set and entire set. In summary, our RBP‐based model could be a novel prognostic predictor and had the potential for developing treatment targets for DLBCL., We found that six RNA binding proteins are significantly related to the overall survival of diffuse large B‐cell lymphoma (DLBCL) patients, which could potentially be served as prognostic biomarkers. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis provided insight into the underlying mechanisms in the occurrence and development of DLBCL, which laid the foundation for further basic studies.},

The heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins F, H1, and H2 (hnRNP F/H) are splicing factors that preferentially bind to poly(G)-rich sequences RNA. Here, we demonstrate that hnRNP F/H associate with both hTERC and telomerase holoenzyme to regulate telomerase activity. We reveal hnRNP F/H bind to the 5'-end region of hTERC in vitro and in vivo, and identify the first three G-tracts of hTERC and qRRM1 domain of hnRNP F/H are required for their interaction. Furthermore, hnRNP F/H also directly interact with telomerase holoenzyme. Functionally, we show that hnRNP F/H plays important roles in modulating telomerase activity and telomere length. Moreover, hnRNP F/H deletion greatly impair cancer and stem cell proliferation, and induce stem cell senescence, while hnRNP F/H overexpression delay stem cell senescence. Collectively, our findings unveil a novel role of hnRNP F/H as the binding partners of hTERC and telomerase holoenzyme to regulate telomerase function.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: High throughput parallel sequencing, RNA-Seq, has recently emerged as an appealing alternative to microarray in identifying differentially expressed genes (DEG) between biological groups. However, there still exists considerable discrepancy on gene expression measurements and DEG results between the two platforms. The objective of this study was to compare parallel paired-end RNA-Seq and microarray data generated on 5-azadeoxy-cytidine (5-Aza) treated HT-29 colon cancer cells with an additional simulation study. METHODS: We first performed general correlation analysis comparing gene expression profiles on both platforms. An Errors-In-Variables (EIV) regression model was subsequently applied to assess proportional and fixed biases between the two technologies. Then several existing algorithms, designed for DEG identification in RNA-Seq and microarray data, were applied to compare the cross-platform overlaps with respect to DEG lists, which were further validated using qRT-PCR assays on selected genes. Functional analyses were subsequently conducted using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA). RESULTS: Pearson and Spearman correlation coefficients between the RNA-Seq and microarray data each exceeded 0.80, with 66\%\textasciitilde 68\% overlap of genes on both platforms. The EIV regression model indicated the existence of both fixed and proportional biases between the two platforms. The DESeq and baySeq algorithms (RNA-Seq) and the SAM and eBayes algorithms (microarray) achieved the highest cross-platform overlap rate in DEG results from both experimental and simulated datasets. DESeq method exhibited a better control on the false discovery rate than baySeq on the simulated dataset although it performed slightly inferior to baySeq in the sensitivity test. RNA-Seq and qRT-PCR, but not microarray data, confirmed the expected reversal of SPARC gene suppression after treating HT-29 cells with 5-Aza. Thirty-three IPA canonical pathways were identified by both microarray and RNA-Seq data, 152 pathways by RNA-Seq data only, and none by microarray data only. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that RNA-Seq has advantages over microarray in identification of DEGs with the most consistent results generated from DESeq and SAM methods. The EIV regression model reveals both fixed and proportional biases between RNA-Seq and microarray. This may explain in part the lower cross-platform overlap in DEG lists compared to those in detectable genes.},

We now show that the F-box protein Fbw7 interacts with and thereby destabilizes c-Myc in a manner dependent on phosphorylation of MB1. Whereas wild-type Fbw7 promoted c-Myc turnover in cells, an Fbw7 mutant lacking the F-box domain delayed it. Furthermore, depletion of Fbw7 by RNA interference increased both the abundance and transactivation activity of c-Myc. Accumulation of c-Myc was also apparent in mouse Fbw7-/- embryonic stem cells.

IkappaBzeta (also known as MAIL and INAP) is an ankyrin-repeat-containing nuclear protein that is highly homologous to the IkappaB family member Bcl-3 (refs 1-6). Transcription of IkappaBzeta is rapidly induced by stimulation with TLR ligands and interleukin-1 (IL-1). Here we show that IkappaBzeta is indispensable for the expression of a subset of genes activated in TLR/IL-1R signalling pathways. IkappaBzeta-deficient cells show severe impairment of IL-6 production in response to a variety of TLR ligands as well as IL-1, but not in response to tumour-necrosis factor-alpha. Endogenous IkappaBzeta specifically associates with the p50 subunit of NF-kappaB, and is recruited to the NF-kappaB binding site of the IL-6 promoter on stimulation. Moreover, NF-kappaB1/p50-deficient mice show responses to TLR/IL-1R ligands similar to those of IkappaBzeta-deficient mice. Endotoxin-induced expression of other genes such as Il12b and Csf2 is also abrogated in IkappaBzeta-deficient macrophages. Given that the lipopolysaccharide-induced transcription of IkappaBzeta occurs earlier than transcription of these genes, some TLR/IL-1R-mediated responses may be regulated in a gene expression process of at least two steps that requires inducible IkappaBzeta.},

  abstract = {The transcription factor nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) plays crucial roles in a wide variety of cellular functions and its activity is strictly regulated by cytosolic inhibitors known as IκBs. We here report a new member of the IκB protein family, IκB-ζ, harboring six ankyrin repeats at its carboxyl terminus. IκB-ζ mRNA is strongly induced after stimulation by lipopolysaccharide. The induction of IκB-ζ is also observed by stimulation with interleukin-1β but not by tumor necrosis factor-α. In contrast to cytosolic IκB-α, -β, and -ε, the induced IκB-ζ localizes in the nucleus via its amino-terminal region, which shows no homology with other proteins. Transiently expressed IκB-ζ inhibits the NF-κB activity without affecting the nuclear translocation of NF-κB upon stimulation. The expressed IκB-ζ preferentially associates with the NF-κB subunit p50 rather than p65 and recombinant IκB-ζ proteins inhibit the DNA binding of the p65/p50 heterodimer and the p50/p50 homodimer. Thus, IκB-ζ negatively regulates NF-κB activity in the nucleus, possibly in order to prevent excessive inflammation. Moreover, transfection of IκB-ζ renders cells more susceptible to apoptosis induced by tumor necrosis factor-α. The proapoptotic activity of IκB-ζ further suggests that it might be one of key regulators for inflammation and other biologically relevant processes.},

  abstract = {The genetics and pathogenesis of splenic marginal zone lymphoma are poorly understood. The lymphoma lacks chromosome translocation, and approximately 30\% of cases are featured by 7q deletion, but the gene targeted by the deletion is unknown. A recent study showed inactivation of A20, a "global" NF-κB negative regulator, in 1 of 12 splenic marginal zone lymphomas. To investigate further whether deregulation of the NF-κB pathway plays a role in the pathogenesis of splenic marginal zone lymphoma, we screened several NF-κB regulators for genetic changes by PCR and sequencing. Somatic mutations were found in A20 (6/46=13\%), MYD88 (6/46=13\%), CARD11 (3/34=8.8\%), but not in CD79A, CD79B and ABIN1. Interestingly, these genetic changes are largely mutually exclusive from each other and MYD88 mutation was also mutually exclusive from 7q deletion. These results strongly suggest that deregulation of the TLR (toll like receptor) and BCR (B-cell receptor) signaling pathway may play an important role in the pathogenesis of splenic marginal zone lymphoma.},

  abstract = {Purpose: The causes of disproportionate incidence and mortality of prostate cancer among African Americans (AA) remain elusive. The purpose of this study was to investigate the mechanistic role and assess clinical utility of the splicing factor heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein H1 (hnRNP H1) in prostate cancer progression among AA men.Experimental Design: We employed an unbiased functional genomics approach coupled with suppressive subtractive hybridization (SSH) and custom cDNA microarrays to identify differentially expressed genes in microdissected tumors procured from age- and tumor grade–matched AA and Caucasian American (CA) men. Validation analysis was performed in independent cohorts and tissue microarrays. The underlying mechanisms of hnRNPH1 regulation and its impact on androgen receptor (AR) expression and tumor progression were explored.Results: Aberrant coexpression of AR and hnRNPH1 and downregulation of miR-212 were detected in prostate tumors and correlate with disease progression in AA men compared with CA men. Ectopic expression of miR-212 mimics downregulated hnRNPH1 transcripts, which in turn reduced expression of AR and its splice variant AR-V7 (or AR3) in prostate cancer cells. hnRNPH1 physically interacts with AR and steroid receptor coactivator-3 (SRC-3) and primes activation of androgen-regulated genes in a ligand-dependent and independent manner. siRNA silencing of hnRNPH1 sensitized prostate cancer cells to bicalutamide and inhibited prostate tumorigenesis in vivo.Conclusions: Our findings define novel roles for hnRNPH1 as a putative oncogene, splicing factor, and an auxiliary AR coregulator. Targeted disruption of the hnRNPH1-AR axis may have therapeutic implications to improve clinical outcomes in patients with advanced prostate cancer, especially among AA men.

We identified recurrent mutations in genes that are well known to be functionally relevant in MCL, including ATM (37.5\%), TP53 (31.3\%), WHSC1 (31.3\%), CCND1 (18.8\%), NOTCH2 (6.3\%), and CDKN2A (6.3\%). We also identified somatic mutations in genes for which a functional role in MCL has not been previously suspected. These genes included CCDC15, APC, CDH1, S1PR1, ATRX, BRCA2, CASP8, and NOTCH3. Further, we investigated the prognostic factors associated with MCL from clinical, pathological, and genetic mutations. Mutations of TP53 (P\,=\,0.021) was a significant prognostic factor with shorter overall survival (OS). Although there was no statistical difference, the median survival time of patients with WHSC1 mutations was shorter than those without mutations (P\,=\,0.070). Mutations in ATM and CCND1 had no prognostic value (P\,=\,0.552, 0.566). When adjusted for MCL International Prognostic Index (MIPI) or combined MCL-International Prognostic Index (MIPI-c), TP53 and WHSC1 mutations were the most important prognostic factors in MCL (P\,{$<$}\,0.05). Our data provide an unbiased view of the landscape of mutations in MCL and commend that all patients benefit from mutations of TP53 and WHSC1 at diagnosis, in addition to MIPI and MIPI-c score.},

We characterized seven genomic mutational signatures, including two B cell tumor-specific signatures, one of which is novel and associated with aberrant SHM. We further identified two major mutational signatures (K1 and K2) of clustered mutations (kataegis) resulting from the activities of AID or error-prone DNA polymerase η, respectively. K1 was associated with the immunoglobulin (Ig) switch region mutations/translocations and the ABC subtype of DLBCL, whereas K2 was related to the Ig variable region mutations and the GCB subtype of DLBCL and FL. Similar patterns were also observed in chronic lymphocytic leukemia subtypes. Thus, alterations associated with aberrant CSR and SHM activities can be linked to distinct developmental paths for different subtypes of B cell lymphomas.},

F-box and WD repeat domain containing 7 (FBXW7), also known as Sel10, hCDC4 or hAgo, is a member of the F-box protein family, which functions as the substrate recognition component of the SCF E3 ubiquitin ligase. FBXW7 is a critical tumor suppressor and one of the most commonly deregulated ubiquitin-proteasome system proteins in human cancer. FBXW7 controls proteasome-mediated degradation of oncoproteins such as cyclin E, c-Myc, Mcl-1, mTOR, Jun, Notch and AURKA. Consistent with the tumor suppressor role of FBXW7, it is located at chromosome 4q32, a genomic region deleted in more than 30\% of all human cancers (Spruck CH et al., Cancer Res 62:4535-9, 2002). Genetic profiles of human cancers based on high-throughput sequencing have revealed that FBXW7 is frequently mutated in human cancers. In addition to genetic mutations, other mechanisms involving microRNA, long non-coding RNA, and specific oncogenic signaling pathways can inactivate FBXW7 functions in cancer cells. In the following sections, we will discuss the regulation of FBXW7, its role in oncogenesis, and the clinical implications and prognostic value of loss of function of FBXW7 in human cancers.},

  abstract = {Follicular lymphoma (FL) is the second most common non-Hodgkin lymphoma in the Western world. FL cell-intrinsic and cell-extrinsic factors influence FL biology and clinical outcome. To further our understanding of the genetic basis of FL, we performed whole-exome sequencing of 23 highly purified FL cases and 1 transformed FL case and expanded findings to a combined total of 114 FLs. We report recurrent mutations in the transcription factor STAT6 in 11\% of FLs and identified the STAT6 amino acid residue 419 as a novel STAT6 mutation hotspot (p.419D/G, p.419D/A, and p.419D/H). FL-associated STAT6 mutations were activating, as evidenced by increased transactivation in HEK293T cell-based transfection/luciferase reporter assays, heightened interleukin-4 (IL-4) -induced activation of target genes in stable STAT6 transfected lymphoma cell lines, and elevated baseline expression levels of STAT6 target genes in primary FL B cells harboring mutant STAT6. Mechanistically, FL-associated STAT6 mutations facilitated nuclear residency of STAT6, independent of IL-4-induced STAT6-Y641 phosphorylation. Structural modeling of STAT6 based on the structure of the STAT1-DNA complex revealed that most FL-associated STAT6 mutants locate to the STAT6-DNA interface, potentially facilitating heightened interactions. The genetic and functional data combined strengthen the recognition of the IL-4/JAK/STAT6 axis as a driver of FL pathogenesis.},

We examined 782 cells from cell lines and triple-negative breast xenograft tumors. Low-depth sequencing, compared with existing methods, revealed greater coverage uniformity and more reliable detection of copy-number alterations. Using phylogenetic analysis, we found minor xenograft subpopulations that were undetectable by bulk sequencing, as well as dynamic clonal expansion and diversification between passages. Merging single-cell genomes in silico, we generated 'bulk-equivalent' genomes with high depth and uniform coverage. Thus, low-depth sequencing of DLP libraries may provide an attractive replacement for conventional bulk sequencing methods, permitting analysis of copy number at the cell level and of other genomic variants at the population level.},

  abstract = {B cells and T cells are key players in the defence against infections and malignancies. To exert their function, B cells and T cells differentiate into effector and memory cells. Tight regulation of these differentiation processes is key to prevent their malfunction, which can result in life-threatening disease. Lymphocyte differentiation relies on the appropriate timing and dosage of regulatory molecules, and post-transcriptional gene regulation (PTR) is a key player herein. PTR includes the regulation through RNA-binding proteins (RBPs), which control the fate of RNA and its translation into proteins. To date, a comprehensive overview of the RBP expression throughout lymphocyte differentiation is lacking. Using transcriptome and proteome analyses, we here catalogued the RBP expression for human B cells and T cells. We observed that even though the overall RBP expression is conserved, the relative RBP expression is distinct between B cells and T cells. Differentiation into effector and memory cells alters the RBP expression, resulting into preferential expression of different classes of RBPs. For instance, whereas naive T cells express high levels of translation-regulating RBPs, effector T cells preferentially express RBPs that modulate mRNA stability. Lastly, we found that cytotoxic CD8+ and CD4+ T cells express a common RBP repertoire. Combined, our study reveals a cell type-specific and differentiation-dependent RBP expression landscape in human lymphocytes, which will help unravel the role of RBPs in lymphocyte function.}

  abstract = {Canine lymphoma (cL) is a common type of neoplasia in dogs with an estimated incidence rate of 20–100 cases per 100,000 dogs and is in many respects comparable to non-Hodgkin lymphoma in humans. Although the exact cause is unknown, environmental factors and genetic susceptibility are thought to play an important role. cL is not a single disease, and a wide variation in clinical presentations and histological subtypes is recognized. Despite this potential variation, most dogs present with generalized lymphadenopathy (multicentric form) and intermediate to high-grade lymphoma, more commonly of B-cell origin. The most common paraneoplastic sign is hypercalcemia that is associated with the T-cell immunophenotype. Chemotherapy is the treatment of choice and a doxorubicin-based multidrug protocol is currently the standard of care. A complete remission is obtained for most dogs and lasts for a median period of 7–10 months, resulting in a median survival of 10–14 months. Many prognostic factors have been reported, but stage, immunophenotype, tumor grade, and response to chemotherapy appear of particular importance. Failure to respond to chemotherapy suggests drug resistance, which can be partly attributed to the expression of drug transporters of the ABC-transporter superfamily, including P-gp and BCRP. Ultimately, most lymphomas will become drug resistant and the development of treatments aimed at reversing drug resistance or alternative treatment modalities (e.g. immunotherapy and targeted therapy) are of major importance. This review aims to summarize the relevant data on cL, as well as to provide an update of the recent literature.},

Consistently, Crebbp-deficient B cells exhibit enhanced response to mitogenic stimuli and perturbed plasma cell differentiation. Although GC-specific loss of Crebbp was insufficient to initiate malignant transformation, compound Crebbp-haploinsufficient/BCL2-transgenic mice, mimicking the genetics of FL and DLBCL, develop clonal lymphomas recapitulating the features of the human diseases. These findings establish CREBBP as a haploinsufficient tumor-suppressor gene in GC B cells and provide insights into the mechanisms by which its loss contributes to lymphomagenesis.Significance: Loss-of-function mutations of CREBBP are common and early lesions in FL and DLBCL, suggesting a prominent role in lymphoma initiation. Our studies identify the cellular program by which reduced CREBBP dosage facilitates malignant transformation, and have direct implications for targeted lymphoma therapy based on drugs affecting CREBBP-mediated chromatin acetylation.

These 'somatic eQTLs' (expression quantitative trait loci) are frequently mutated in specific cancer tissues, and the majority can be validated in an independent cohort of 3,382 tumors. Among these, we find that the effects of noncoding mutations on DAAM1, MTG2 and HYI transcription are recapitulated in multiple cancer cell lines and that increasing DAAM1 expression leads to invasive cell migration. Collectively, the noncoding loci converge on a set of core pathways, permitting a classification of tumors into pathway-based subtypes. The somatic eQTL network is disrupted in 88\% of tumors, suggesting widespread impact of noncoding mutations in cancer.},

We recently showed that RNA G-quadruplexes, which serve as cis-elements to recruit splicing factors, play a critical role in regulating alternative splicing during the epithelial-mesenchymal transition. In this study, we performed a high-throughput screen using a dual-color splicing reporter to identify chemical compounds capable of regulating G-quadruplex-dependent alternative splicing. We identify emetine and its analog cephaeline as small molecules that disrupt RNA G-quadruplexes, resulting in inhibition of G-quadruplex-dependent alternative splicing. Transcriptome analysis reveals that emetine globally regulates alternative splicing, including splicing of variable exons that contain splice site-proximal G-quadruplexes. Our data suggest the use of emetine and cephaeline for investigating mechanisms of G-quadruplex-associated alternative splicing.},

  abstract = {Combining gene expression (GE) profiles generated from different platforms enables previously infeasible studies due to sample size limitations. Several cross-platform normalization methods have been developed to remove the systematic differences between platforms, but they may also remove meaningful biological differences among datasets. In this work, we propose a novel approach that removes the platform, not the biological differences. Dubbed as ‘MatchMixeR’, we model platform differences by a linear mixed effects regression (LMER) model, and estimate them from matched GE profiles of the same cell line or tissue measured on different platforms. The resulting model can then be used to remove platform differences in other datasets. By using LMER, we achieve better bias-variance trade-off in parameter estimation. We also design a computationally efficient algorithm based on the moment method, which is ideal for ultra-high-dimensional LMER analysis.Compared with several prominent competing methods, MatchMixeR achieved the highest after-normalization concordance. Subsequent differential expression analyses based on datasets integrated from different platforms showed that using MatchMixeR achieved the best trade-off between true and false discoveries, and this advantage is more apparent in datasets with limited samples or unbalanced group proportions.Our method is implemented in a R-package, ‘MatchMixeR’, freely available at: https://github.com/dy16b/Cross-Platform-Normalization.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

  abstract = {Gall bladder carcinoma (GBC) is the seventh most common cancer across the globe and the most common malignancy of the biliary tract. Most GBC related deaths occur due to secondary progression and metastasis to distant organs. Epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) is an important pre-requisite for tumor metastasis, however its mechanism in GBC has not yet been defined. Using the GBC-SD cell line, we have uncovered an important mediator, poly r(C) binding protein-1 (PCBP1), of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β)-induced EMT in GBC. Our results show that TGF-β treatment resulted in PCBP1 phosphorylation in accordance with similar observation in other model systems. We further showed through gain- and loss-of-function assays that PCBP1 expression levels regulate the capacity of GBC-SD cells to migrate and invade in vitro. Finally, our results showed that PCBP1 expression levels also regulate generation of CD44+CD24− progenitor cell population in GBC-SD cells after TGF-β treatment. Cumulatively, our results indicate, pending further validation, that PCBP1 might be a prognostic marker for GBC metastasis.},

  abstract = {Accumulating evidence show that Poly C Binding Protein 1 (PCBP1) is deleted in distinct types of tumors as a novel tumor suppressor, but its tumor suppression mechanism remains elusive. Here, we firstly describe that downregulation of PCBP1 is significantly associated with clinical ovarian tumor progression. Mechanistically, PCBP1 overexpression affects various autophagy-related genes expression at various expression levels to attenuate the intrinsic cell autophagy, including the autophagy-initiating ULK, ATG12, ATG7 as well as the bona fide marker of autophagosome, LC3B. Accordingly, knockdown of the endogenous PCBP1 in turn enhances autophagy and less cell death. Meanwhile, PCBP1 upregulates p62/SQSTM1 via inhibition p62/SQSTM1 autophagolysome and proteasome degradation as well as its mRNA stability, consequently accompanying with the caspase 3 or 8 activation for tumor cell apoptosis. Importantly, clinical ovary cancer sample analysis consistently validates the relevance of PCBP1 expression to both p62/SQSTM1 and caspase-8 to overall survival, and indicates PCBP1 may be a master player to repress tumor initiation. Taken together, our results uncover the tumorigenic mechanism of PCBP1 depletion and suggest that inhibition of tumor cell autophagy with autophagic inhibitors could be an effective therapeutical strategy for PCBP1-deficient tumor.}

Iterations of this process will lead to affinity maturation, replicating Darwinian evolution on the cellular level. GC B-cell selection can lead to four different outcomes: further expansion and evolution, apoptosis (non-selection), or output from the GC with differentiation into memory B cells or plasma cells. T-helper cells in GC have been shown to have a central role in regulating B-cell selection by sensing the density of major histocompatibility complex (MHC):peptide antigen complexes. Antigen is provided on follicular dendritic cells in the form of immune complex. Antibody on these immune complexes regulates antigen accessibility by shielding antigen from B-cell receptor access. Replacement of antibody on immune complexes by antibody generated from GC-derived plasma cell output will gradually reduce the availability of antigen. This antibody feedback can lead to a situation where a slow rise in selection stringency caused by a changing environment leads to directional evolution toward higher affinity antibody.},

To determine the prevalence and distribution of FOXO1 mutations in pediatric Burkitt lymphoma (BL), we sequenced a large number of sporadic and endemic BL patient samples. We report a high frequency of FOXO1 mutations in both sporadic and endemic BL at diagnosis, occurring in 23/78 (29\%) and 48/89 (54\%) samples, respectively, as well as 8/16 (50\%) cases at relapse. Mutations of T24 were the most common in sporadic BL but were rare in endemic cases, in which mutations of residue S22, also within the AKT recognition motif, were the most frequent. FOXO1 mutations were almost always present in the major tumor cell clone but were not associated with outcome. Analysis of other recurrent mutations reported in BL revealed that FOXO1 mutations were associated with mutations of DDX3X and ARID1A, but not MYC, TCF3/ID3, or members of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase signaling pathway. We further show common nuclear retention of the FOXO1 protein, irrespective of mutation status, suggesting alternative unknown mechanisms for maintaining FOXO1 transcriptional activity in BL. CRISPR/Cas9 knockout of FOXO1 in an endemic cell line produced a significant decrease in cell proliferation, supporting an oncogenic role for FOXO1 in endemic BL. Thus, FOXO1 is frequently mutated in both sporadic and endemic BL and may offer a potential therapeutic target for pediatric BL patients worldwide.},
