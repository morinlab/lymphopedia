## Overview

First described as mutated in BL in 2009 by Grande et al.[@grandeGenomewideDiscoverySomatic2019]


## Experimental Evidence

Driver mutations affecting this gene in DLBCL/BL have been experimentally demonstrated to cause a reduction or loss of function (LOF).[@weberPiggyBacTransposonTools2019]
