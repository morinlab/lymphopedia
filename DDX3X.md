## Overview
Mutations in the DDX3X gene, which encodes an RNA helicase involved in various aspects of RNA metabolism, have significant implications in B-cell lymphomas, including BL, DLBCL, and other related malignancies and are particularly enriched within MYC-translocated tumors and those expressing the dark zone signature (DZsig).[@ennishiDoubleHitGeneExpression2019] 
These mutations are predominantly loss-of-function (LOF) mutations, affecting the helicase domain of the protein. Missense mutations are predominantly found in male patients and rarely in females, hence showing a sex-specific pattern.[@gongSequentialInverseDysregulation2021]


## Experimental Evidence

Driver mutations affecting this gene in DLBCL/BL have been experimentally demonstrated to cause a reduction or loss of function (LOF).[@gongSequentialInverseDysregulation2021]
