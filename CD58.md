## Overview

CD58, also known as lymphocyte function-associated antigen 3 (LFA-3), is crucial for immune recognition, facilitating interactions between tumor cells and cytotoxic T cells and natural killer (NK) cells. 

## Experimental Evidence

In DLBCL, mutations prevent the expression of CD58 on the cell surface, impairing the ability of T and NK cells to recognize and attack the tumor cells. 
This is often accompanied by mutations in the Î²2-Microglobulin gene, which further aids in immune evasion.[@challa-malladiCombinedGeneticInactivation2011]
