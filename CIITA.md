## Overview
CIITA encodes the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II transactivator.  CIITA mutations are frequent in PMBCL. These mutations often include structural genomic rearrangements, missense, nonsense, and frameshift mutations. In PMBCL, these mutations are thought to contribute to loss of MHC expression.[@mottokGenomicAlterationsCIITA2015]  Although loss of CIITA and MHC Class II Expression is commonly observed in DLBCL, the role of mutations and methylation affecting this locus remains unclear.[@morinFrequentMutationHistonemodifying2011] CIITA is one of [a number of genes](https://github.com/morinlab/LLMPP/wiki/ashm) affected by aberrant somatic hypermutation in B-cell lymphomas, which complicates the interpretation of mutations at this locus. The relevance of CIITA mutations in DLBCL remains unclear. [Selective pressure analysis](#mutation-pattern-and-selective-pressure-estimates) did not identify this gene as significantly enriched for either missense or truncating mutations, indicating that many of these mutations may represent passengers. 


## Experimental Evidence

Driver mutations affecting this gene in DLBCL have been experimentally demonstrated to cause a reduction or loss of function (LOF).[@mottokGenomicAlterationsCIITA2015]
