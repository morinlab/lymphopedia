## Overview
Mutations in GNA13, which encodes a G protein alpha subunit involved in multiple signaling pathways, have been identified as significant contributors to the pathogenesis of germinal centre-derived B-cell lymphomas, including diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and Burkitt lymphoma (BL).[@reichelFlowSortingExome2015] This gene has some recurrent sites of mutations (hot spots). Overall, mutations are often loss-of-function in nature, disrupting the normal activity of GNA13. GNA13 regulates B-cell homing and growth suppression within the germinal center niche and its loss of function promotes lymphoma development.[@loveGeneticLandscapeMutations2012]



## Experimental Evidence

Driver mutations affecting this gene in BL/FL/DLBCL have been experimentally demonstrated to cause a reduction or loss of function (LOF).[@muppidiLossSignalingGa132014; @ohayreInactivatingMutationsGNA132016]
