## Overview

P2RY8 encodes a G proteinâ€“coupled receptor that is expressed on germinal center B cells. Signals through this receptor promote confinement of B cells to the GC niche.[@muppidiLossSignalingGa132014] 
Downstream signaling through Galpha13 (encoded by GNA13) and S1PR2 is distrupted by mutations of one of these genes in GC lymphomas including the GCB subgroup of DLBCL and BL.[@muppidiLossSignalingGa132014] 


## Experimental Evidence

Driver mutations affecting this gene in BL/DLBCL have been experimentally demonstrated to cause a reduction or loss of function (LOF).[@muppidiLossSignalingGa132014]
