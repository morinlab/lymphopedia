## Overview

Mutations in BL were first described by Grande et al.[@grandeGenomewideDiscoverySomatic2019]


## Experimental Evidence

Driver mutations affecting this gene in BL have been experimentally demonstrated to cause a reduction or loss of function (LOF).[@toncUnexpectedSuppressionTumorigenesis2021]
