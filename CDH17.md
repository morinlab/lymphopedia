## Overview

Due to [minimal support](CDH17#representative-mutations) in the original primary data and very few mutations reported in subsequent studies, this gene is very unlikely to be relevant in BL. 


## Relevance tier by entity

[[include:tables/table1_CDH17.md]]

## Warnings

<<Warn("The variants reported in this gene failed QC")>>
