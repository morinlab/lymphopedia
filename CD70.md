## Overview
CD70 is a costimulatory molecule expressed on some activated lymphocytes and has a role in T-cell-mediated immune responses. 
CD70 aberrations are relatively common in DLBCL and appear more frequent in certain DLBCL patient populations. For instance, in a Chinese DLBCL cohort, 24% of cases exhibited CD70 genetic changes, compared to 10.8% in a Swedish cohort.[@nieDualRoleCD702022]
CD70 mutations are associated with the BN2 genetic subtype of DLBCL.[@wrightProbabilisticClassificationTool2020] 
The mutation pattern in CD70 is consistent with the preferential accumulation of *inactivating mutations*. 
Genetic perturbation limits the development of an effective CD8+ T-cell immune response in Bcl6-driven DLBCL. [@nieDualRoleCD702022]
In mouse models, CD70 loss promoted lymphomagenesis, consistent with its role as a tumor suppressor gene in B-cell lymphomas.[@mandatoAbstractA38Cd702022]


## Experimental Evidence

Driver mutations affecting this gene in DLBCL have been experimentally demonstrated to cause a reduction or loss of function (LOF).[@nieDualRoleCD702022]
