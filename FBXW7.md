## Overview
FBXW7 mutations are found in a range of lymphoid malignancies, including B-cell lymphomas. These mutations often include missense mutations, deletions, frameshift mutations and splice-site mutations. 
Overall, these mutations are relatively rare in DLBCL and occur more frequently in other solid tumors as well as T-cell acute lymphocytic leukemia.[@akhoondiFBXW7HCDC4General2007] 
The most commonly observed mutations in those cancers are the hot spots R465 and R479.[@akhoondiFBXW7HCDC4General2007]
In leukemias, FBXW7 mutations enhance the activity of leukemia-initiating cells by stabilizing oncogenic MYC.[@kingUbiquitinLigaseFBXW72013] Whether they have this role in DLBCL remains to be determined. 


## Experimental Evidence

Driver mutations affecting this gene in DLBCL have been experimentally demonstrated to cause a reduction or loss of function (LOF).[@saffieFBXW7TriggersDegradation2020]
