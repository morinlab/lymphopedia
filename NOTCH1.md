## Overview

The relevance of NOTCH1 mutations in various malignancies has been well established. However, *due to [minimal support](NOTCH1#representative-mutations) in the original primary data and very few mutations reported in subsequent BL studies, this gene is very unlikely to be relevant in BL.* 



## Experimental Evidence

Driver mutations affecting this gene in DLBCL have been experimentally demonstrated to cause a gain of function (GOF).[@ryanCellRegulomeLinks2017]
