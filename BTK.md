[[_TOC_]]
One study reported BTK mutations in approximately 7% of FL and 11% of transformed FL cases.[@krysiakRecurrentSomaticMutations2017] Another showed these mutations were more common, and typically co-occur in tumours with BCL2 translocations. Despite the known role of certain BTK mutations in acquired resistance to BTK inhibitors, these mutations were found in BTK inhibitor-na√Øve patients.[@albuquerqueEnhancingKnowledgeDiscovery2017] These mutations often occur in treatment-naive patients and lead to inactivation of the BTK protein through destabilization or by altering key residues involved in enzymatic activity.[@krysiakRecurrentSomaticMutations2017] The mutation pattern in DLBCL and FL implies the preferential accumulation of *inactivating mutations*[@huFollicularLymphomaassociatedBTK2021; @schejbelInactivatingBTKMutations2022]. No notable hot spots have been described in this gene in the context of the cancers listed below. 


## Experimental Evidence

Driver mutations affecting this gene in FL/DLBCL have been experimentally demonstrated to cause a reduction or loss of function (LOF).[@huFollicularLymphomaassociatedBTK2021]
