## Overview

BCOR acts as a co-repressor of BCL6, and mutations in BCOR could impair its binding affinity to BCL6 and other partners. Overall, protein-altering mutations in BCOR seem to be rare in DLBCL and MCL.[@jalladesExomeSequencingIdentifies2017],[@nadeuGenomicEpigenomicInsights2020] One study reported a much higher prevalence of a hot spot mutation in BCOR but this result has not been reproduced.[@jalladesExomeSequencingIdentifies2017]
