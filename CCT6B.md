## Overview

Due to [minimal support](CCT6B#representative-mutations) in the original primary data and very few mutations reported in subsequent studies, this gene is very unlikely to be relevant in BL. 


## Relevance tier by entity

[[include:table1_CCT6B.md]]

## Warnings

<<Warn("The variants reported in this gene failed QC")>>

## Mutation incidence in large patient cohorts (GAMBL reanalysis)

|Entity|source               |frequency (%)|
|:------:|:---------------------:|:-------------:|
|BL    |GAMBL genomes+capture|1.15         |
|BL    |Thomas cohort        |  NA         |
|BL    |Panea cohort         |  NA         |
