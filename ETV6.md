## Overview
ETV6 is one of [a number of genes](https://github.com/morinlab/LLMPP/wiki/ashm) affected by aberrant somatic hypermutation in B-cell lymphomas, which complicates the interpretation of mutations at this locus. 
The prevalence of mutations in DLBCL has varied across different studies and may occur in as many as 10% of patients. 
This gene has some recurrent sites of mutations (hot spots) including multiple mutations predicted to affect splicing of ETV6 pre-mRNA. 
The mutation pattern in DLBCL mplies the preferential accumulation of *inactivating mutations*. 
Coding and non-coding mutations in this gene are associated with the MCD genetic subgroup of DLBCL. 



## Experimental Evidence

Driver mutations affecting this gene in DLBCL have been experimentally demonstrated to cause a reduction or loss of function (LOF).[@wangETV6MutationCohort2014]
