## Overview
JUNB has been reported to be frequently mutated in T-cell/histiocyte-rich large B-cell lymphoma (THRLBCL).<sup>[@schuhmacherJUNBDUSP2SGK12019]</sup> Mutations have also been reported in DLBCL but the mutation rate in the earliest study<sup>[@reddyGeneticFunctionalDrivers2017]</sup> was likely an over-estimate.<sup>[@drevalRevisitingReddyDLBCL2023]</sup> According to one study, mutations are often enriched at somatic hypermutation hotspot sites, indicating the involvement of aberrant somatic hypermutation in the pathogenesis of these lymphomas.<sup>[@schuhmacherJUNBDUSP2SGK12019]</sup>
