## Overview
JUNB has been reported to be frequently mutated in T-cell/histiocyte-rich large B-cell lymphoma (THRLBCL).[@schuhmacherJUNBDUSP2SGK12019] Mutations have also been reported in DLBCL but the mutation rate in the earliest study[@reddyGeneticFunctionalDrivers2017] was likely an over-estimate.[@drevalRevisitingReddyDLBCL2023] According to one study, mutations are often enriched at somatic hypermutation hotspot sites, indicating the involvement of aberrant somatic hypermutation in the pathogenesis of these lymphomas.[@schuhmacherJUNBDUSP2SGK12019]
