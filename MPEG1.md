## Overview
Mutations in MPEG1 have been described in DLBCL[@morinMutationalStructuralAnalysis2013] with the overall rate of mutations somewhat variable across studies. MPEG1 is one of [a number of genes](https://github.com/morinlab/LLMPP/wiki/ashm) affected by aberrant somatic hypermutation in B-cell lymphomas, which complicates the interpretation of mutations at this locus. Coding and non-coding MPEG1 mutations are a feature of the MCD genetic subgroup of DLBCL.
