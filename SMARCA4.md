## Overview

SMARCA4 is a member of the SWI/SNF family of proteins. The encoded protein is part of the large ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complex SNF/SWI, which can allow expression of genes repressed by chromatin. 
Overall, components of SWI/SNF have been identified as an emerging theme in germinal centre-derived B-cell lymphomas. [@lunningMutationChromatinModifiers2015]



## Experimental Evidence

Driver mutations affecting this gene in DLBCL/FL/BL have been experimentally demonstrated to cause a reduction or loss of function (LOF).[@fernandoFunctionalCharacterizationSMARCA42020]
